<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This book is intended as an historical reader, an elementary
text-book in the history of our country, or as an introduction or
supplement to any of the excellent text-books on the history of
the United States now in use.</p>

<p>The aim has been not only to interest children in the great
men of their own country, but to stimulate them to the cultivation
of the lofty virtues of which they read, and to instil within
their hearts a deep love for their native land.</p>

<p>All the main facts in our early history have been given as simply
and vividly as possible, and the lessons of patriotism, truthfulness,
courage, patience, honesty, and industry taught by the
lives of our principal heroes are carefully enforced. Great pains
have also been taken to relate all the well-known anecdotes and
quote the famous speeches which are so frequently alluded to in
our current literature.</p>

<p>Although this book ends with the Revolutionary War, the story
of our country is continued on the same lines in a companion
volume entitled "The Story of the Great Republic;" yet each
book is independent of the other and can be used separately.</p>

<p>So simply worded as to be easily intelligible to average children
of ten or twelve years of age, the text is further arranged in short
paragraphs, to facilitate its use as a reader in large classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The pronunciation of difficult proper names is indicated in the
text, and, more fully, in the carefully prepared index. The system
of diacritical marks used is explained on the first page of the index.</p>


<p class="center">HINTS FOR TEACHERS.</p>

<p>The best results in reading can often be obtained by the
teacher's reading a chapter first, while the pupils closely follow
the text in their own books. When called upon to re-read the
same passages, it will be noticed that they almost unconsciously
imitate every inflection they have heard. Thus they soon learn
to read with due regard to expression, and therefore take a livelier
interest in the subject-matter.</p>

<p>Aside from its use as a reader, this text can also serve to
supply themes for daily language work, certain parts of the lesson
being chosen for verbal and others for written reproduction.
My experience has been that after reading the chapters over once
or twice most children remember both facts and names. If they
cannot do it at first, they may easily be trained to do it by the
judicious stimulus of a little praise, and the hope of winning their
teacher's approval.</p>

<p>To fix important facts in the memory, and to serve as reviews
of previous readings, I have found that a set of question cards is
almost invaluable. These can be quickly distributed among the
children, who are called upon to answer them verbally or in writing,
as best serves the teacher's purpose at the time.</p>

<p>Pupils consider historical matches even more exciting than
spelling matches. To vary recitations, matches can be conducted
in various ways. For instance, all the question cards bearing
upon the parts of the book already perused can be divided between
the two "sides." The pupils furnish oral or written answers, the
side answering most questions correctly reaping the honors. The
match can also be carried on by the teacher's supplying names
or dates, and requiring pupils on alternate sides to state clearly
what they know in connection with them. At other times, ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
quiz methods can be used, or the teacher can relate some
fact or anecdote, calling upon different pupils to supply the purposely
omitted names or dates.</p>

<p>Children are also often deeply interested in verbal pictures.
For example, the teacher, without mentioning name, time, or
place, can describe Franklin flying his kite, Ethan Allen surprising
the garrison at Ticonderoga, Columbus at La Rabida,
etc. The description ended, each pupil can write down the
names of the characters described, and mention time, place, and
any other fact the teacher calls for. Such historical riddles seem
more like play than work to the average child, and before long
all take great pride in making verbal pictures of their own, to be
guessed by their schoolmates, or handed to the teacher instead
of an ordinary composition. Such work not only appeals to
childish imagination, but cultivates memory and attention while
firmly fixing important facts in youthful minds.</p>

<p>To encourage a taste for poetry and rouse a love for the beautiful
by fine descriptions of the noted characters or great events
with which the pupils have just become familiar, it is often well to
read aloud some of our most famous songs or poems.</p>

<p>It is universally conceded that history and geography should
go hand in hand; so suitable maps have been supplied, upon which
children should be encouraged to locate each spot as soon as
it is mentioned. The teacher should also procure a blank map
for each pupil (such as the Eclectic Map Blanks, American Book
Company), so that, after finding any place named on the ordinary
map, the pupil can locate it exactly on an outline map. Many
children are greatly interested in marking the names themselves
as soon as their attention is drawn to them, and take great pride
in seeing their maps grow. This method is often more helpful
than any other in making children see how civilization has spread
and what changes have gradually taken place in our country.</p>

<p>To fix upon their minds the fact that colonies were planted
by different European nations, it is often advisable to purchase
at a stationer's tiny adhesive stars of various colors. Each color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
serves to represent a nation, and stars are pasted upon the spots
where colonies once stood. In cases where colonies proved unsuccessful,
a black star can be pasted over the colored one, but
in such a way that enough of the original star remains to show
to which nation the colony once belonged. Where colonies
changed hands several times, stars of appropriate colors can be
pasted overlapping one another. This work fascinates children,
and as the stars are adhesive, it can be done in class with very
little trouble. A little tact on the teacher's part will make each
pupil strive to have the neatest and most accurate map.</p>

<p>History and geography, when studied in their turn, will seem
far more attractive to children if these methods have been
pursued; for many persons and places already familiar will then
be joyfully greeted as old friends.</p>

<p class="center b17"><strong>STORY OF THE THIRTEEN COLONIES.</strong></p>




<h2>I. OUR COUNTRY LONG AGO.</h2>


<p>Learned men, who read the story of the earth in the
mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, and seas which cover
its surface, tell us that America, although known as the
New World, is really older than Europe. The sun has
shone upon this continent and the rain has watered it for
more centuries than we can count. If you study your
maps carefully, you will notice lofty mountains, great lakes,
and long rivers in many parts of the country; and you will
see that it is beautiful and fertile almost everywhere, except
in the far north, where snow covers the ground most
of the year.</p>

<p>The same wise men who found out that the country
is so old, dug down into the soil, examined the things
they found there, questioned the Indians, and, little by
little, discovered that our continent has been inhabited by
many different kinds of animals and men. They found
huge bones of animals which died thousands of years ago,
and placed these in museums, where you can now see
them. They also found the bones of some of the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
men and women, with some of their weapons, tools,
kitchen pots, and bits of their garments.</p>

<p>By studying these things very carefully, and by listening
to the stories of the natives, they learned a great deal
about the country which, from Greenland and A-las´ka
in the north, to Cape Horn in the south, was once inhabited
by tribes of Indians.
None of these had white
skins like the inhabitants
of Europe, black skins
like the negroes in Africa,
or yellow skins like
the Chinamen in Asia.
But as they were more
like the people in Asia
than like those in Africa
or Europe, some men
now think they may once
have belonged to the
same family.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Savage Indian.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Still, the men living
on our continent were so
unlike others that they
are called red men, and
form a race by themselves. Those who lived in the part
of the country which is now called the United States had
copper-colored skins, high cheek bones, straight, coarse
black hair, small black eyes, and very wide mouths. Although
they all looked somewhat alike, they were very
different in their ways of living. The Indians living east
of the Rocky Mountains were a little more civilized than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
those living west of those mountains and in the far northern
parts of the continent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p015.jpg" width="250" height="338" alt="wigwam" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Wigwam.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The western and northern Indians are generally called
savage Indians, for they lived by hunting and fishing, had
no houses like ours, and were always roaming around in
search of game. They were sheltered from the sun and
rain by tents called wigwams. These rude dwellings
were made by driving poles in the ground, in a circle as
big as the wigwam was to be. When
all the poles had been set up, the tops
were drawn close together and firmly
tied. Over these slanting poles the
Indians spread the skins of the
animals they had killed, or else
they wove leaves and branches between
the poles to form a thick
screen. The space between
two of the poles was
left open to serve as
a door, and over this
was hung a bear or buffalo
skin to keep out
the sun, rain, or cold.</p>

<p>The space inside the wigwam
was generally very small;
but all the family crowded in,
and when it was cold or wet, a fire was lighted in the
middle of the floor. The smoke then escaped through
a hole purposely left in the top of the wigwam, or through
the open door.</p>

<p>The savage Indians had learned to make baskets, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
they plastered with clay inside and out, and dried in the
sun until they could hold water. When they wanted to boil
their meat or to warm water, the women, called squaws,
heated stones in the fire, and then dropped them into the
water, which was thus brought to a boil.</p>

<p>These Indians rowed about in canoes made of basket
work, of birch bark, or even of hollow tree trunks. As
they had only stone axes, they could not easily cut down
trees, so they brought them to the ground by kindling a
fire all around them. When the tree had fallen they built
another fire farther up the trunk. A log of the right
length having thus been secured, they hollowed it out by
starting small fires on top of the trunk, and scraping away
the charred wood, until the log formed a rude canoe.</p>

<p>The Indians made their birch-bark canoes by sewing
long strips of bark together with plant fibers or the sinews
of the animals they had killed. The basket-work canoes
were covered with skins to make them water-tight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>




<h2>II. THE BARBAROUS INDIANS.</h2>


<p>The Indians east of the Rocky Mountains knew a little
more than the savage Indians, so they are called the
barbarous Indians. Besides hunting and fishing, they dug
up roots with stone hoes, or with shells, and planted corn,
beans, pumpkins, squashes, tomatoes, tobacco, and sunflowers.
Of course they did not have neat fields and
gardens, such as you see now; but they scratched a
hole wherever the ground seemed good enough, dropped
a few seeds into it, and covering them over, left them
to grow without further care.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p017.jpg" width="450" height="171" alt="pottery" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Indian Pottery.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The barbarous Indians were not content, like the savage
Indians in the West, to fling a skin around them to keep
off the cold, merely fastening it with a big thorn to hold
it together. So they made winter garments by sewing
skins together with sinews or plant fibers. In summer
they had lighter clothes, rudely woven out of cotton or
plant fibers. They, too, wove baskets, made beautiful
birch-bark canoes, and after fashioning pots and pans out
of clay, hardened them in the fire, so that they could use
them in cooking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>These Indians had tools and weapons made of finely
polished stone or bone, and they liked to live in villages.
Instead of wigwams, many of them built houses of wood,
or basket work and clay, roofed over with strips of bark.
Sometimes the roof was a very thick layer of long grass,
laid on rude rafters, and held down by poles to form a kind
of thatch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p018.jpg" width="450" height="158" alt="long house" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Long House.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The houses thus built were generally very long and
rather narrow, with a door at either end, and a passageway
running through the center. On either side of this
hall there were little rooms, each occupied by a family.
At intervals along the passage the ground was hollowed
out, and a clay or earthen fireplace was built, where four
families cooked their meals. Above the fireplace there
was a hole in the roof to serve as chimney. The rooms
near the doors were generally used as storerooms for food
and fuel. When several of these long houses were built
together, they were often surrounded by a wooden wall,
or palisade, to keep out the wild beasts and to serve as
protection in time of war.</p>

<p>The Indians who once lived in New York and in the
valley of the St. Law´rence lived in long houses, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Mis-sou´ri Indians had round houses, built of the same
materials. In the round houses the fireplace was in the
middle, and families lived in rooms shaped like cuts of a
pie. Many of these round houses were built close together,
and then surrounded by a palisade made of tree
trunks. These were driven into the ground so close
together that they formed a very strong fence.</p>

<p>Although Indians did not have family names, such as we
have now, each great family, or clan, had a special sign
whereby it was known, such as a bear, a turtle, or a beaver.
This sign was often marked upon their bodies in bright
colors, and they carved and scratched it on all their
belongings. From this sign the family was known as the
bear, the turtle, or the beaver clan. Each clan selected a
ruler, called sachem, or sagamore, whose orders all obeyed,
and they also chose a chief to lead them in time of war.</p>

<p>The Indians had never been told about the God we
love, so they worshiped the sun, moon, and stars, the
lightning and thunder, the wind and rain, and said that
one great spirit, called Man´i-to, was always watching
over them. They also believed that when they died they
would be carried off to a place where they could hunt and
fish forever, and they called this heaven the happy hunting
grounds.</p>

<p>Their religious ceremonies were usually performed by
Indians called medicine men. These pretended to be
very wise, and frightened the others by dancing and yelling
wildly, and using strange words and signs. They said
this would please their gods, and drive away the evil spirits
of sickness, storm, or drought. The Indians were so simple
that they believed all this nonsense, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
so afraid of evil spirits that
they often begged an animal's
pardon for killing
it. You see, they thought
the spirit of a wolf or bear
might else be so angry as
to torment them in their
dreams!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p020.jpg" width="250" height="418" alt="papoose" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Papoose.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The men spent their
time hunting, fishing, and
fighting, but left all the
rest of the work to the
women. When they
moved from one place to
another, the squaws had
to carry all the household
goods, as well as the papooses,
or babies. But the
men carried only their
bows and arrows, hunting knives, and the hatchets called
tomahawks, which they threw with great force and skill.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>III. THE MOUNDS.</h2>


<p>Besides the savage Indians of the north and west, and
the barbarous Indians of the east, there were also half-civilized
Indians in the south of our country. They dwelt
not only in what is now New Mex´i-co and Ar-i-zo´na, but
were also found in Mexico, Central America, and South
America, as far down the map as Chile (che´lā).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The southern Indians had learned how to build canals,
so as to lead the water far away from the streams into
dry and barren lands. When the ground had thus been
watered, or irrigated, it became very fruitful, and they
could grow all the grain and vegetables they needed.</p>

<p>The southern Indians lived together in huge fortresses,
built of sun-dried bricks, called adobe. These fortresses
were large houses five or six stories high, containing ever
so many little rooms, each occupied by one family. Thus
one house often sheltered two or three thousand people.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p021.jpg" width="250" height="171" alt="cliffs" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Cliff Dwellings.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes these Indians built their houses on the ledges
of steep rocks, or canyons. Such houses were called cliff
dwellings, and many remains of these queer homes are
still found in the southwestern part of our country. The
Indians who lived there were gentle, and not fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
fighting, but they built fortresses and cliff dwellings to
defend themselves when attacked by the savage Indians.</p>

<p>You see, the savage Indians did not grow any grain or
vegetables, but they came down from the north to steal
the provisions of the southern Indians. These, therefore,
carried all their supplies into the cliff houses, which they
built in such a way that it was almost impossible for an
enemy to get in them.</p>

<p>The inhabitants themselves, however, easily went in
and out by means of ladders, which led from story to
story, or from ledge to ledge. Their houses had no doors
down near the floor, but were entered by a hole in the roof.</p>

<p>In each of these fortresses there was a great cistern, full
of water, and so large a supply of food that the Indians
could stand a long siege. In times of danger they pulled
all their ladders away up out of reach, and when their
enemies tried to climb the steep cliffs or straight walls,
they pelted them with stones and arrows, and thus drove
them away.</p>

<p>Wise men tell us that even before our country was
occupied by the savage, barbarous, and half-civilized
Indians, whose way of living has just been described, it
had been inhabited by their ancestors or by an older race
of men. We know they existed, because people have
dug up their bones. These have been found principally
inside huge earthen mounds of very queer shapes. The
mounds were evidently built by those early inhabitants,
who are hence known as the mound builders. Trees
hundreds of years old now grow upon these mounds,
which are found in most parts of the eastern Mis-sis-sip´pi
valley, especially in O-hi´o.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>In one place you can see a big mound representing a
snake one thousand feet long, his body lying in graceful
curves along the ground.
This snake's mouth is
wide open, and he
looks as if trying
to swallow
an egg-shaped
mound, which is one
hundred and sixty-four feet
long, and hence a pretty big mouthful.
As this mound is so odd, it
has been inclosed in a park, where it
is to be kept just as it is, to remind people
of the mound builders who lived here so long ago.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p023a.jpg" width="250" height="194" alt="snake" />

</div>

<p>No one now knows exactly why these queer mounds were
made, but learned men have dug into about two thousand
of them, and as they have generally found bones, stone
arrowheads and axes, beads, mortars, hammers, tools for
spinning and weaving, pottery, baskets, and coarse cloth,
they think the mounds must have been intended principally
as burying places. The beads found in them are
very like those
which the barbarous
Indians
called wampum
and used as
money. Indians
wore these beads in strings around their necks, or
wove them into belts, using beads of different colors to
form very pretty patterns.</p>

<h2>IV. WHERE THE NORTHMEN WENT.</h2>


<p>As you have seen in the first chapters of this book,
America was once a very different country from what
it is to-day. Now you are going to learn how it changed,
little by little, from the wild land where Indians roamed
about in the huge forests covering the greater part of the
country, into a civilized country.</p>

<p>We are told that in all the wide territory now occupied
by the United States, there were, four hundred and fifty
years ago, about two hundred thousand Indians. These
were very few inhabitants for so big a country, for now
there are many cities here which count many more citizens.</p>

<p>The Indians then little suspected that on the other side
of the great ocean there was another country, occupied by
a race of white men, who knew much more than they did,
and who were soon coming to take possession of their
land.</p>

<p>But the people in Europe, wise as they were, did not
know many things which everybody knows now. That
was not their fault, however, for they had been trying for
several centuries to learn all they could. In the middle
of the fifteenth century Europe was already an old country,
where long series of kings and queens had ruled over
the people. There were then in Europe cities more than
two thousand years old, ancient temples and castles, and
many of the beautiful Christian churches which people
still admire, because none finer have ever been built.</p>

<p>The people in Europe had long been great travelers by
land and sea, although it was not so easy to get about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
then as it is now. Indeed, on land they could go only in
wagons, in litters, on horseback, or on foot; and on the
water they used nothing but rowboats or sailboats, because
no one had yet imagined that one could use steam
or electricity. On the sea, even the boldest sailors did not
dare venture far out of sight of land, for fear they would
not be able to find their way back.</p>

<p>The best seamen in Europe were the Northmen, or
vik´ings. Already in the eighth century they used to sail
out of the <i>viks</i>, or bays, in Nor´way, every spring, to go
in search of adventures. These Northmen, Norsemen, or
Normans, little by little explored the coast of the North
Sea, and of the Atlantic Ocean, and finally came to the
Strait of Gi-bral´tar. Passing through this opening, they
came to the beautiful Med-i-ter-ra´ne-an Sea, where they
cruised about, even visiting the Greek islands and the renowned
city of Con-stan-ti-no´ple.</p>

<p>As you will see by looking at your maps, this was a
very long journey for men who had nothing but sailboats
or rowboats, such as very few sailors would dare to use
nowadays. But the Northmen were afraid of nothing,
and when the wind blew, and the great waves tossed their
little vessels up and down like cockleshells, they held
tight to the rudder and steered on, singing one of their
famous songs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the tempest raged so fiercely that
they were driven far out of their course. Thus, in the
middle of the ninth century, one of these hardy seamen,
after tossing about on the stormy seas several days, landed
on an island which he had never seen before.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/illus_p026.jpg" width="389" height="600" alt="viking" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Viking.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This new place was Ice´land, and he was so pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a><br /><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with his discovery that he sailed home and persuaded his
family and friends to go back there with him to settle
down. In a few years other Northmen came to live in
Iceland, sailing across the Atlantic from time to time to
visit their old homes and friends. Soon the colony grew
so large that its seamen kept up a lively trade with different
ports in Europe.</p>

<p>One of these Ice-lan´dic seamen, Gunn´biorn, on his
way home, was once overtaken by a violent storm. It
drove him far out of his course, and finally brought him
in sight of a new land, covered with snow, which he called
the White Land. When he reached home he told the
Ice´land-ers what he had seen; but no one cared then to
go and see if there really was a land west of Iceland, as
he had said.</p>

<p>About a hundred years later another man, Er´ic the
Red, was driven out of Iceland for murder. Remembering
what Gunnbiorn had said, he sailed westward, and
went to settle in the new country, which he called Greenland,
so as to attract other settlers. A number of them
soon joined him there, and began to trade with the
Es´ki-mos, a race of Indians who lived in the coldest part
of the country, where they hunted white bears and fished
for cod and seals.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>V. THE NORTHMEN IN AMERICA.</h2>


<p>After Eric the Red had settled in Greenland, he sent
word to one of his friends, Biar´ni, to come and visit
him. Biarni gladly accepted the invitation, and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he had none of the instruments which sailors now use to
guide them safely over the seas, he set out boldly, steering
his course by the stars.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Biarni, a storm soon came up. The
stars could no longer be seen, and his ship was driven far
out of its way. When the skies cleared Biarni saw land
before him, and fancied he had reached Greenland. So
he sailed slowly along the coast, looking for Eric's settlement;
but, as he could not find it, he soon turned around
and went back to Iceland.</p>

<p>Of course he told his adventures to his friends, and
Leīf the Lucky, hearing him describe the land he had
seen, set out in search of it, in a large ship manned by
a number of men. Sailing westward, Leif coasted along
Lab-ra-dor´ and No´va Sco´tia, came to Cape Cod (map,
page 189), and landed, it is thought, somewhere in Rhode
Island, in the year 1001.</p>

<p>Although Biarni and Leif did not know it, they had
been the first white men to see North America, which, as
you will see, did not receive this name till many years
later. Leif the Lucky found so many wild grapes in this
region that he called the country Vine´land, and loading
his ship with timber and grapes, he went home. But he,
with another Northman, soon came back to spend a winter
in the new country, where the climate was much milder
than in Iceland or Greenland.</p>

<p>For some years ships sailed from Norway to Iceland,
from Iceland to Greenland, and from Greenland to North
America, where a Northman finally settled with about
one hundred and forty men and women. Snor´ri, the
son of this brave leader, was the first European child born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in America. He lived to grow up, and the great sculptor
Thor´wald-sen, as well as several other noted men, claimed
him as one of their ancestors.</p>

<p>The Northmen, however, had a very hard time in
America, for they were soon attacked by the Indians,
whom they called Skrae´lings. Even the women had to
fight to defend themselves against the savages. But when
they found that these attacks did not cease, they decided
to leave the country, and went home in 1012.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p029.jpg" width="450" height="381" alt="ship" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Viking's Ship.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As far as we know, after that no ships from the North
visited America for several hundred years. But the story
of Eric the Red and of Leif the Lucky was, fortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
written down in one of the old Norse tales, or sagas. It
is probable that the people went on talking for some time
of the strange country their friends had visited, but after
a while they forgot it entirely. Indeed, were it not for
the old story, no one would now know that they were the
first Europeans who set foot in our country, and you will
still hear some people deny that they ever came here.</p>

<p>Now, it may seem very strange to you that the news
of the Norse discovery of the new land was not made
known everywhere; but you must remember that the
people in Europe had no newspapers or printing presses,
and that news traveled very slowly. No one but a few
Northmen, therefore, were aware that land had been found
in the West.</p>

<p>So America was forgotten until, according to an old
story, a Welsh prince named Mad´oc was driven across
the Atlantic by a storm, in the twelfth century. He was
so well pleased with the new country he found that he is
said to have left some of his men there, promising to return
soon with more settlers. The story goes on to say
that he sailed from Wales to keep this promise, but no
one ever heard anything more of him, or of the men he
left in America.</p>

<p>Some people think that he and his men perished in a
storm, and that the settlers he left behind him were murdered
by the Indians. Others insist that the whole story
was made up by the Welsh, so they could claim the honor
of having discovered America. Whether the Welsh ever
came here or not,&mdash;and it is hardly likely they ever did,&mdash;the
fact remains that our continent, after being discovered
by Europeans, was lost again.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI. QUEER IDEAS.</h2>


<p>People living in Europe, near the sea, were all fond of
cruising about; but as they had no compass at first,
they seldom ventured out of sight of land, for fear of losing
their way. After a time they learned to steer their vessels
by means of the stars; but as these could serve as guides
only on clear nights, sailors were glad to use the compass
when it became known in Europe, in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>But although seamen now fearlessly cruised about the
European waters, they did not venture far out into the
Atlantic, which was then known as the "Sea of Darkness."
The fact is, they were afraid to do so, because they had
been told they would meet strange monsters there, such
as mermen and mermaids. They also thought their vessels
would be drawn toward the "Loadstone Mountain,"
a great magnetic rock which would draw all the nails
out of their planks, and thus make their boats fall to pieces.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p031.jpg" width="250" height="143" alt="primitive" />
</div>

<p>Of course this was all nonsense, but most of the seamen
believed these tales as firmly as some sailors now believe
that Friday is an unlucky
day; and as no
one had ever gone far
out in the Atlantic,
even learned men
could not prove to
them that they were
mistaken. Besides,
although they had fairly good maps of the countries they
had visited, people knew nothing at all of the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
world. Their maps showed only the northern part of
Africa, the western and southern parts of Europe, and the
western part of Asia. All the rest was a blank.</p>

<p>Common people then believed that the earth was round
and flat, like a pie, with the ocean flowing all around it.
So they were afraid to venture too far out, lest they should
fall over the edge of the world and drop down into space!
Wise men, however, already knew better; for, about three
hundred years before Christ, Greek philosophers had begun
to suspect that the earth is round like a ball, and not
flat, as every one until then had supposed.</p>

<p>They and their pupils wrote books giving their reasons
for believing this; but as printing was not invented till
seventeen hundred years later, these works were known
only to a few learned men. Most of the European scholars
then lived in Greece or Constantinople, and kept these
precious manuscripts in monasteries or private libraries, or
in palaces and schools.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century a Spanish-A-ra´bi-an philosopher
read some of these Greek manuscripts, and then wrote a
book, saying that he not only believed that the earth is
round, but that he thought it would be possible to sail
around it! This statement, so natural and simple now,
seemed so absurd to the people who heard it then that
they began to make all manner of fun of it. They asked
how it would be possible for a ship to sail uphill, even
supposing it did not tumble off the earth when it reached
the edge, which they called the jumping-off place.</p>

<p>They also asked how the trees on the other side of the
earth could grow with their roots up in the air, and inquired
whether the rain and snow flew up instead of falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
down. These questions, which seem so odd now, were
very natural, for people did not then know, what your
teachers have explained to you, that the earth is like a
big magnet. It holds fast everything on its surface, and
nothing can fall off, even though it spins around and
around, and whirls through space much faster than the
fastest express train can travel.</p>

<p>The Turks, who were not Christians, besieged the city
of Constantinople in 1453, and when they became masters
of it, and of the surrounding country, the learned men
all fled, taking with them many of their precious manuscripts.
Deprived of their quiet homes, and in many cases
forced to teach to earn their living, these wise men settled
in various cities, where they imparted to others all they
knew.</p>

<p>As printing had just been invented, books, instead of
being worth a fortune, soon became so much cheaper that
almost everybody could afford to have one or two volumes.
The precious manuscripts the wise men had saved
from the Turks were therefore printed, and people soon
began to talk about the strange things they read in them,
and longed to know more.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>VII. PRINCE HENRY THE NAVIGATOR.</h2>


<p>Among the first books printed were the accounts of
the travels of two daring men, Mar´co Po´lo and
Sir John Man´de-ville. These men had visited many of
the countries of the East, and the first had even gone to
China, which was then called Ca-thay´. The stories these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
travelers told were so interesting and exciting that people
became anxious to visit these strange countries,
and especially to trade there and thus grow rich.</p>

<p>Ever since the days of Al-ex-an´der the Great, if not
sooner, a certain amount of trading had been done with
the East. But as all the silk,
sugar, spices, etc., had to be
brought by coasting vessels
to the head of the Per´sian
Gulf or the Red Sea, and
thence overland by caravans
to some port on the Black
Sea or the Mediterranean,
they became very costly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p034.jpg" width="450" height="426" alt="caravan" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Caravan.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, too, the goods were brought all the way
from China or India, or the heart of Africa, through deserts
and over mountains to the Black, the Mediterranean, or
the Red Sea, by caravan, although it took a long while to
travel all those weary miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>For some time the Turks allowed this trade to go on,
but by and by they began to treat the traders so badly
that the traffic almost stopped. The cities of Ven´ice and
Gen´o-a in Italy, whose ships had constantly sailed to and
fro in the Mediterranean and Black seas, to carry these
goods from port to port, were now nearly idle, and the
people who had grown so rich were about to become poor.</p>

<p>As the Turks were too strong to be driven away, the
traders longed to find another road to reach India, Cathay,
and Ci-pan´go, or Japan. A way of reaching these countries
by sea was what they most desired, because it is
much easier to carry goods in ships than on camels.</p>

<p>The Ve-ne´tians and Gen-o-ese´, however, were not the
only ones who wished to find a new road to the East.
Many of the European coast cities fancied that if they
could only discover it, they could keep the trade all to
themselves, and thus grow richer and more powerful than
their neighbors.</p>

<p>One of the countries which most coveted the Eastern
trade was Por´tu-gal, where a bright boy was heir to the
throne. This lad, Prince Henry of Portugal, once went
with his father to Ceu´ta in Africa. Although then very
young, he listened eagerly to the wonderful stories told
about Guin´ea, on the southern side of the Sa-ha´ra. He
soon began to wonder if it would not be possible to get
there by sailing along the coast instead of crossing the
African desert. This, you must know, was a great undertaking,
because people found nothing to eat or drink
there, and suffered much from the heat. Besides, the
wind called the simoom raised such clouds of dust that
whole caravans were sometimes buried in the sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>By looking at the maps in your geography, you can see
that it was easy to sail from Portugal to Guinea; but at
that time people knew nothing of the west coast of Africa.
Prince Henry, in hopes of solving the problem, began
to study very hard. Before long he read in an old book
that a wise man thought it possible to sail all around
Africa, and he longed to find out if this was true.</p>

<p>As soon as he grew up, he therefore hired a number
of seamen to try it, and showed such interest in sea
voyages that he is often called the Navigator. The
mariners thus sent out, little by little explored the coast
of Africa, and creeping farther south every journey, they
discovered the Ma-dei´ra and Canary Islands.</p>

<p>But the sight of the smoke above the volcano of Ten-er-ïfe´
so terrified them that they dared go no farther. It
was only some time later that Por´tu-guese mariners
reached the Cape Verde Islands and Sen-e-gal´. But one
of their number had in the meantime learned, from a
Flem´ish seaman, that there was a group of islands westward,
and the Portuguese, going there, planted a colony on
the A-zores´, which still belong to them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>VIII. YOUTH OF COLUMBUS.</h2>


<p>While Henry the Navigator was busy with his discoveries,
the rest of the world was not standing
still. Although he little suspected it, a boy born in
Genoa, about 1436, was to be a far greater navigator
than he. This boy was Christopher Columbus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Christopher's father was only a poor wool
comber, he managed to send his son to school at Pavia
(pah-ve´a). There the little fellow studied hard. But he
had no pretty books such as you have now, and had to
pore over musty parchments. In spite of that, he took
special interest in geography and mathematics. When
only thirteen, Christopher was forced to leave school, because
his father could not afford to keep him there any
longer. After combing wool for a short time, he went
to sea with one of his relatives.</p>

<p>A sailor at fourteen, Columbus began to lead a very
stirring and adventurous life. Genoa, his native city, was
then often at war with other places, and battles were fought
on the sea as well as on land. Besides, in going about
from place to place, Genoese vessels were frequently overtaken
by pirates; so mariners in those days had to know
how to fight, as well as how to sail their vessels. Columbus,
therefore, had more than one battle with these sea
robbers, whose aim was to secure the goods on board his
ship. Once he took part in a fight off Cape St. Vin´cent.
Here, his vessel having caught fire, he and his crew sprang
into the sea to escape the flames. By rare good fortune,
Columbus managed to grasp a floating oar, and with this
slight help he swam to the distant shore.</p>

<p>In the course of his many journeys Columbus visited all
the principal ports of the Mediterranean Sea. Ever eager
to learn, he questioned the seamen and travelers he met,
and they gladly told him the strange things they had seen
and heard while visiting foreign lands.</p>

<p>After a time Columbus came to Lis´bon, hoping to be
employed in making discoveries for the crown; for, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
have seen, the Portuguese were the boldest seamen of the
day. Whether or not Columbus took part in some of
their journeys we do not now know; but we do know that
he soon found himself obliged to earn his scanty living by
drawing maps. As he was a very pious man, he daily
went to say his prayers in a neighboring convent church,
where he met a young lady whom the nuns were educating.
Falling in love with her, Columbus soon made her his wife.</p>

<p>The newly married couple lived with the mother of
the bride, the widow of a seaman and chart maker. She
soon gave her son-in-law her husband's papers and instruments.
In looking over the former, Columbus found
that his wife's father had once been in the employ of
Henry the Navigator, and had written an account of his
voyages.</p>

<p>Poring over these papers, and thinking over all he had
read and heard from travelers, Columbus became more
and more convinced that the earth is round, and that
by sailing directly westward one would reach the coast of
Asia. This idea, which had already haunted him for
some time, now left him no rest He longed to try, for
he was in hopes of finding a new road to India, which
would enable his native city to carry on the trade which
had made it so rich. This trade had been stopped, when
he was about seventeen, by the taking of Constantinople,
as you have already heard.</p>

<p>According to the calculations of Columbus,&mdash;for, like
all the wise men of his time, he fancied the earth smaller
than it is,&mdash;the lands known to the Europeans extended
over about two thirds of the surface of the globe. As
he thought that Asia stretched much farther east, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
now began to think that perhaps the strip of ocean which
separated Cipango from the Canary Islands might not be
so very broad, after all.</p>

<p>To discover whether others shared this belief, Columbus
wrote to Tos-ca-nel´li, a learned Italian, asking him
whether he thought it possible to reach Asia by sailing
straight across the Atlantic. Toscanelli answered that he
thought it could be done. He also sent Columbus a map he
had drawn, on which he had placed Cipango (Japan) nearly
on the spot which Cu´ba occupies in your geographies.</p>

<p>When Columbus received this map he determined to
make an attempt to reach Asia by boldly sailing westward.
But he was too poor to buy or hire a vessel himself, and
we are told that when he once asked the Genoese to
supply him with one, offering to give them the benefit
of his discoveries, they only made fun of his plans.</p>

<p>Although disappointed, Columbus did not give up his
idea, and still tried to gain all the information he could.
He even made a journey to Iceland; but the people he
talked with there had so entirely forgotten the land that
Eric and Biarni had visited in the west, that they never
even mentioned it to him, so far as we now know.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>IX. COLUMBUS AND THE QUEEN.</h2>


<p>Genoa having refused to help him, Columbus, some
time later, explained his wishes to John II., the
new king of Portugal, for Henry the Navigator was dead.
This ruler also took great interest in such matters, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
as he was not very wise himself, he called together a
council of his most learned men to listen to all that Columbus
had to say. These men declared the plan absurd;
but the king did not feel quite sure that they were right.</p>

<p>John did not wish any other country to have the glory
of finding the new road to India; still, he did not want to
trust a ship to Columbus. Advised by one of his bishops,
he secretly sent out a light ship, with orders to sail directly
westward. The captain and crew did not believe one
could sail across the Atlantic, and were sorely afraid of
the monsters which they fancied swarmed in the Sea of
Darkness. They therefore took advantage of the very
first storm to come back, reporting that it was impossible
to go any farther.</p>

<p>When Columbus heard that the king had been so dishonest
as to try to steal his ideas, he was justly indignant.
He left Lisbon in anger, vowing he would have nothing
more to do with such a ruler. Still, as he was fully determined
not to give up his cherished plan to try himself,
he sent his brother Bar-thol´o-mew to England to ask if
Henry VII. would give him a ship.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Columbus staid in Spain, earning a
scanty living for himself and his little son Diego (de-ā´go);
for by this time his wife had died, leaving him alone with
this child. But although so poor that he often had to beg
food, Columbus thought night and day of the time when
he would sail westward to Asia. As he went from place
to place, he tried to interest various people in his plans,
and for a while believed that some Spanish noblemen
would help him.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus_p041.jpg" width="600" height="396" alt="Isabella" />
<div class="caption"><p><small><i>V. Brozik, Artist.</i></small></p>

<p class="center">Columbus at the Court of Ferdinand and Isabella.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But they finally told him they could not undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a><br /><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
such an important expedition, and advised him to apply
for aid to the king and queen at Cor´do-va. Hoping still,
Columbus journeyed thither, and found that the royal
couple were too busy trying to drive the Moors out of
Spain to pay much attention to him.</p>

<p>Time went on thus, and while Columbus was anxiously
waiting, Portuguese seamen crept down the coast of
Africa until they reached its southern point. There a
tempest raged so fiercely that the captain called it the
Cape of Storms, and, not daring to venture around it,
sailed home. When he told John II. of his discovery,
the king declared that the cape should henceforth be called
the Cape of Good Hope, for there were now good prospects
of reaching India by coasting all around Africa.</p>

<p>In 1487, the very year that the Portuguese thus finished
exploring the western coast of Africa, Columbus was
called before the learned men of the Spanish court at
Sal-a-man´ca, to explain what it was he wanted to do.</p>

<p>But after talking about his plan for three years, these
men also declared it was impossible, because one of the
fathers of the church had said that the earth could not be
round. Columbus was in despair, for he had spent years
in trying to convince them, and in following the court
from one city to another.</p>

<p>Greatly discouraged, yet determined not to give up,
Columbus decided to leave Spain and go to France to seek
help of the French king. He therefore set out on foot
for the nearest seaport, but on the way thither stopped at
the monastery of La Rábida (rah´be-dah) to ask for a
drink of water and a bit of bread for his hungry boy.</p>

<p>While the child was eagerly eating the food given him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the prior, or chief of the monastery, passed by. Struck
by the noble appearance of Columbus, he began to question
him. Columbus
then told Prior Perez
(pā´reth) how much he
longed to carry out the
plan upon which he had
set his heart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p043.jpg" width="250" height="177" alt="rabida" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">La Rábida.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The prior, who was
a learned man, listened
with great interest to
the tale Columbus told.
He also invited the travelers to tarry with him a few
days, and sending for his friends, bade them hear what
the stranger had to say. Among the listeners were the
brothers Pinzon (peen-thōn´), experienced seamen from
the neighboring port of Palos (pah´lōs).</p>

<p>The prior and the Pinzons were so impressed by all
Columbus said that the latter offered to furnish a ship and
go with him, provided he could secure enough help to
carry out his plan. As for the prior, he offered to go to
court and persuade Queen Is-a-bel´la&mdash;whose confessor
he had once been&mdash;to supply the necessary funds.</p>

<p>True to his resolve, the prior rode off on his mule, and
laid the whole subject so simply and plainly before Isabella
that she promised to give all the help needful. This
answer so pleased Perez that he wrote to Columbus, "I
came, I saw, God conquered," and sent him money, bidding
him come to court without further delay.</p>

<p>It seemed at first as if Columbus's troubles were now
over; but in spite of all Isabella's good will, some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
passed by before she and King Fer´di-nand could hear
him. Then, more delays having occurred, Columbus set
out, in disgust, to try his luck elsewhere. But Isabella,
fearing that the chance of great wealth and honor would
escape her, sent a messenger after him, saying she would
even pledge her own jewels to raise the necessary sum.
Hearing this, Columbus came back, and only with great
difficulty secured a royal promise that he should have
the title of admiral, that he and his descendants should
govern any lands he discovered for Spain, and that he
and they should receive one tenth of all the pearls, gold,
and spices brought to Spain from these new countries.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>X. "LAND! LAND!"</h2>


<p>In 1492, therefore, more than eighteen years after he
began asking for help to carry out his daring plan,
Columbus sailed out of the port of Palos with three little
vessels&mdash;the <i>Santa Maria</i> (sahn´tah mah-ree´ah), the
<i>Pinta</i> (peen´tah), and the <i>Niña</i> (neen´yah). Columbus
himself commanded the first, the Pinzon brothers were
captains of the other ships, and the crews, all told, consisted
of about one hundred men.</p>

<p>The vessels were small and uncomfortable, without real
decks, cabins, or holds; but Columbus started out boldly
to brave unknown dangers and venture into strange seas.
His course was first southward, because he intended to
get fresh water at the Canary Islands before sailing due
west in search of Asia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p045.jpg" width="250" height="203" alt="maria" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Santa Maria.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Although still in well-known waters, the seamen already
seemed doubtful and afraid, and the third day after they
sailed, the <i>Pinta</i> signaled that there was something wrong.
Columbus soon learned
that her rudder was out
of order; and although
Pinzon tried to mend it,
his vessel could not sail
fast.</p>

<p>When Columbus came
to the Canary Islands the
rudder was properly repaired,
and while waiting
for that to be done, he
heard from the inhabitants that after strong westerly
winds they had often found on the beach strangely carved
bits of wood. Once two bodies were washed ashore, and
the islanders said they were those of men unlike any race
ever seen in Europe or the parts of Asia and Africa with
which they were familiar.</p>

<p>Setting out from the Canaries, Columbus quieted the
fears of his crew, when they came within sight of Mount
Tenerife, by explaining to them that it was only a volcano,
like Mount Et´na. Then he steered directly westward.</p>

<p>The men's hearts sank as they lost sight of land, and
all began to think over the terrible stories they had heard.
People who are always looking out for something to get
scared at are easily frightened; so when the three ships
sailed into the warm waters of the middle Atlantic, where
seaweed grows in such quantity as to make the sea look
green, the sailors were terrified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>But Columbus was no faint-heart, and he steered right
on, making the ships cut their way through the floating
masses of seaweed in the Sar-gas´so Sea, as that part of
the Atlantic is called. Perceiving that his men grew more
frightened as the distance increased between them and
their homes, Columbus did not tell them how many miles
they had really gone, but carefully kept the account for
his own use. To cheer his men, he promised a great
reward to the first who caught sight of land.</p>

<p>Instead of looking for mermaids, monsters, and boiling
seas, the sailors now began to watch for land, and several
times they mistook clouds for distant mountain peaks.
Day after day passed on, until the men, horror-struck
at the endless stretch of sea and sky, again and again
begged Columbus to turn around; but he always refused.</p>

<p>Then they grew so angry that they plotted to throw
him overboard and take command of the vessels themselves.
They were on the point of doing this, when they
saw a shrub covered with fresh berries floating over the
waters. A little farther on they found a carved stick and
a small board, and soon after beheld birds flying southward.
By these signs they felt sure land must be near,
and eagerly resumed their watch for it.</p>

<p>To please one of the Pinzon brothers, Columbus unwillingly
consented to change his course and follow the
birds; but if he had gone straight on he would have
landed in what is now called Flor´i-da.</p>

<p>Standing on top of the poor little cabin of his vessel,
on the evening of October 11, Columbus peered out into
the darkness, wondering whether he would see land before
him when the sun rose. Suddenly he fancied he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
saw a light. He called two men, and as they saw it too,
he felt sure they were near land at last.</p>

<p>A few hours later, at early dawn on Friday morning,
October 12, 1492, the <i>Pinta</i>, which was ahead, gave the
joyful signal that land was in sight. When the sun rose,
all on board beheld one of the Ba-ha´mas, which Columbus
mistook for an island off the coast of Asia.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p047.jpg" width="450" height="313" alt="landing" />
<div class="caption"><p><small><i>John Vanderlyn, Artist.</i></small></p>

<p class="center">Landing of Columbus.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Although uncultivated, the island was inhabited, and the
Spaniards soon saw naked savages run out of their low
huts, to stare in wonder at the ships. The poor creatures,
who had never seen sailing vessels before, fancied that
the boats had come straight down from the sky.</p>

<p>Dressed in scarlet, wearing beautiful armor, and carrying
a flag which bore the crowns and initials of Ferdinand
and Isabella, Columbus went ashore in a small boat. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
he set foot upon land, he fell on his knees, and after thanking
God for bringing him there in safety, he took possession
of the island in the name of the king and queen,
and called it San Salvador (sahn sahl-vah-dōr´).</p>

<p>His men, who had been disobedient, hateful, and ready
to kill him such a short time before, now crowded around
him, kissing his hands and feet, and begging his pardon
for their past ill conduct. The natives, who had fled into
the woods at the approach of the strangers, watched all
these proceedings from behind the trees. After a short
time they timidly came forward, and, encouraged by the
Spaniards' kind glances, wonderingly touched the white
men's hands and beards, and evidently admired their gay
apparel.</p>

<p>Columbus was so sure he was near India that he called
the savages Indians, a name which has ever since been
used for the red men in America. Then he gave them
colored caps, glass beads, and little bells, trinkets which
the Indians fancied were priceless heavenly treasures!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XI. COLUMBUS AND THE SAVAGES.</h2>


<p>Although Columbus could not understand one word
of the language the savages spoke, and although
they did not know Spanish, he tried to talk to them. As
you can readily imagine, this was not an easy thing to
do; but by making signs, Columbus soon made the
Indians understand that he would give them more of his
trinkets in exchange for fruit, a kind of bread they showed
him, and the yellow ornaments they wore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>When Columbus found out that these ornaments were
of pure gold, he felt more convinced than ever that he
was near Cipango, Cathay, and India, and he asked the
natives where they had found the precious metal. As
they kept pointing southward, and said words which he
fancied sounded like Cathay and Cipango, he imagined
they were trying to tell him about those countries, and
about a king in the south, who was so rich that all his
dishes were of gold.</p>

<p>The desire to reach this country and to visit Asia's
ruler&mdash;for whom he had brought letters from Ferdinand
and Isabella&mdash;made Columbus set out early on the morrow.
He took with him seven happy natives, whom he
intended to use as interpreters; but they fancied he was
carrying them off to heaven.</p>

<p>Coming to some more small islands, Columbus took
possession of them also; and on the way to a larger one
he overtook a savage in a light canoe. The Spaniards
drew the man on board with his skiff, and as they found
in the latter a gourd of water, some bread, red paint such
as the savages used to beautify themselves, and a string
of the beads they had brought, they concluded he was
going to announce their coming to some friends.</p>

<p>When they drew near the coast, therefore, they sent
this man ashore in his little canoe, and, landing themselves
the next morning, found the savages assembled and ready
to exchange gold and food for worthless European trinkets.</p>

<p>After visiting several of these islands, Columbus steered
southward in search of a larger island, which was Cuba,
but which he at first mistook for Japan. Here the savages
fled at his approach; but Columbus, anxious to make friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with them, went into their huts, and left a few beads in
each, forbidding his men to carry anything away.</p>

<p>Still searching for the wonderful city of the fabulous
ruler who ate and drank from vessels of pure gold, Columbus
coasted along Cuba. As he saw nothing but mean
huts, he fancied that the city must be far inland, and that
none but poor fishermen lived on the shore. He therefore
sent an expedition inland; but his men were sorely disappointed
to find a collection of mud huts instead of the
grand palaces they had expected to behold.</p>

<p>The savages here did something which greatly puzzled
the Spaniards. Taking a certain kind of dried leaf, they
rolled it up, and, lighting one end, stuck the other between
their lips. Then they drew into their mouths and blew
out a strangely perfumed smoke! Seeing that the savages
seemed to enjoy it, the Spaniards tried it also, and thus
became acquainted with the tobacco plant and learned to
smoke.</p>

<p>It was now so late in the season that Columbus did not
dare to wait any longer to secure the cargo of silks, pearls,
spices, and gold which he had hoped to carry home. He
therefore determined to sail back to Spain, make known
his discovery to the king and queen, and fit out a larger
expedition for trading.</p>

<p>On his way home he discovered and took possession of
Hāi´ti, which he called His-pan-io´la, or "Little Spain."
His best ship, the <i>Santa Maria</i>, having been wrecked,
forty men were left behind in a fort there. Columbus bade
them be good to the savages, and learn their language, so
they could tell him all about the great king when he
came back.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>




<h2>XII. HOME AGAIN.</h2>


<p>Columbus set out on his return journey in January,
but he was obliged to go very slowly, because the
wind was often against him, and because one of his vessels
was badly crippled. In the middle of February a terrible
storm separated the two ships, and Columbus, fearing his
vessel would sink, and the news of his discovery perish
with him, wrote out two accounts of his journey. These
were inclosed in cakes of wax, which were put into empty
casks. One of them was cast into the sea, but the other
was left on deck, so it could float off if the boat sank.</p>

<p>The storm grew so fierce that Columbus and his men
vowed to go in procession to the first church they saw
after landing, and return
thanks, if they were
only spared. When the
storm-tossed navigators
finally reached the
Azores, therefore, they
tried to keep this promise;
but the people were
so unkind that they
imprisoned those who
landed. Columbus managed
to recover his men,
but on the way from those islands to Spain another tempest
overtook him, and it was only after much tossing that
the <i>Niña</i> at last reached Portugal.</p>

<p>As soon as he landed, Columbus sent a messenger to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Ferdinand and Isabella to announce his safe return, and
the success of his undertaking. The very people who had
once made fun of him now eagerly listened to all he had
to say, and their hearts were full of envy at the thought
that the newly discovered islands would belong to Spain,
and not to Portugal. It is even said that some one basely
proposed to murder Columbus and send out ships to take
possession of the land in the name of Portugal.</p>

<p>The king, however, would not consent, and Columbus,
sailing away again, finally entered the port of Palos,
whence he had started so
many months before. As
soon as the people heard
that he had succeeded,
they were almost wild
with joy, and rang all the
bells in the city. One
of the Pinzons, who had
hoped that Columbus's
vessel had gone down in
the storm, came into Palos
just then with the <i>Pinta</i>.
He had intended to claim all the honors of the new
discovery, and was greatly disappointed when he found
that Columbus had reached port before him.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Pinta.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As the court was at Bar-ce-lo´na, Columbus immediately
went there, with his Indians, parrots, and other
curiosities, and all along the road people came in crowds
to stare at him. They gazed in wonder at the Indians,
who, in their turn, were bewildered by all the strange
sights they beheld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The royal couple received Columbus in state, and, after
he had bent the knee before them in homage, made him
sit down in their presence&mdash;a great honor&mdash;and relate
his adventures. Columbus gave them glowing descriptions
of the new islands, told them he had found the
road to India, and promised that they should soon be
rich. This news caused such rejoicing that the royal
couple went to give solemn thanks in the chapel.</p>

<p>Honors were now showered upon Columbus, who was
welcomed and feasted everywhere. In fact, people made
such a fuss over him that some of the courtiers became
jealous. A story is told about one of these men who
sneeringly remarked at a banquet that even if Columbus
had not discovered the road across the ocean, there were
plenty of brave Spaniards who could have done so. Columbus
seemed to pay no special attention to this taunt,
but quietly taking an egg from a dish placed in front of
him, he asked the guests if they could make it stand
on end. All tried, and failed. When they finally declared
the feat impossible, Columbus struck the egg on
the table hard enough to break its shell slightly. Then,
leaving it standing there, he calmly said that everything
was equally easy&mdash;after you knew how to do it.</p>

<p>The news brought by Columbus made a sensation
everywhere; but while all the people were talking about
his discoveries, he was actively preparing to cross the
Atlantic again, intending this time to reach India. Instead
of three miserable little ships, and very small crews,
he now had a fleet of seventeen vessels, carrying about
fifteen hundred men.</p>

<p>The second expedition set sail in September, 1493, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
after stopping at the Canary Islands, steered across the
Atlantic to the eastern West Indies. There Columbus
found a fierce race of Căr´ibs, of whose attacks the Indians
had complained to him the year before. The Spaniards
explored these islands, lost their way at times in the forest,
and once came to the homes of some cannibal Caribs.
When they saw a heap of human bones, left over from a
horrible feast, they shuddered with dread at the thought
of falling into the hands of these cruel men.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XIII. COLUMBUS ILLTREATED.</h2>


<p>About one year after leaving the colony at Haiti,
Columbus came back, to find the place deserted.
One of the Indians who had gone to Spain with him
knew enough Spanish by this time to act as interpreter.
Through him, Columbus learned that some of the colonists
had fallen ill and died. The rest, disobeying his orders,
had been cruel and unkind to the natives, and so anxious
to get rich that the Indians, in self-defense, had fallen
upon and killed them.</p>

<p>The site of the first colony having proved so unlucky,
Columbus established the next on another spot, and called
it Isabella, in honor of the queen. Here the Spaniards
began to trade with the natives for gold, and Columbus
sent this metal to Spain, asking that provisions should be
sent out in exchange, because the Spaniards did not like
the natives' food, and had not yet found time to grow
crops for their own use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the gold, Columbus sent back a whole cargo
of men, women, and children, to be sold as slaves. This
was cruel and wicked; but Columbus believed, as most
men did then, that it was far better for the Indians to
be slaves among Christians than free among heathens.</p>

<p>The colonists had expected to grow rich very fast, and
to find all the gold they wanted. They were therefore
sorely disappointed at getting so little, and before long
became discontented and hard to manage. While they
were trading with the natives, Columbus sailed away,
still seeking for India, which he felt sure must be quite
near there.</p>

<p>He went along the coast of Cuba, and then southward
to Ja-māi´ca, finding several other small islands. But after
cruising about for some time, he came back to Isabella,
where he found the colonists ill and unhappy. They had
not only quarreled among themselves, but had illtreated
the natives, robbing them of their wives and daughters,
as well as taking their food.</p>

<p>The Indians, who had once been so happy and indolent,
were now weary and sad. Besides, they had learned to
hate the Spaniards, and were plotting to murder them.
Learning this, Columbus had to treat them as foes, to
protect the Spaniards. The natives next refused to sell
any more food to their enemies, and if a provision ship
had not come from Spain, Columbus and his colony would
surely have died of hunger. As there was very little gold
to send back this time, Columbus shipped all his prisoners
of war, and thus five hundred natives were forwarded to
the Spanish slave market.</p>

<p>During the next two years Columbus had much trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with the Indians, who, finding it almost impossible to collect
the amount of gold he exacted as tribute, often revolted.
He also had a hard time managing the colonists. Homesick
and discouraged, they accused him of deceiving them by
false tales of the riches they could get, and of ruling so
badly that their lives were in danger.</p>

<p>These complaints were sent to Spain, and the royal
couple, hearing so much against Columbus, sent a nobleman
to Haiti to find out if their viceroy was really acting
unjustly. Some people say that this nobleman did not
even try to find out the truth, and Columbus found it
necessary to go back to Spain with him and explain
matters to the king and queen, leaving Bartholomew
Columbus in charge of the colony.</p>

<p>The second arrival of Columbus at court was very different
from the first. Instead of greeting him with cheers
and festivities, people now looked coldly upon him and
avoided him as much as they could. It was only three
years since he had discovered a road across the Atlantic;
but as he had not yet brought back huge cargoes of spices
and silks from India, people openly despised him.</p>

<p>Although this reception cut Columbus to the heart, it
made him all the more anxious to reach India, the goal of
all his hopes. He therefore prepared a third expedition;
but this time he had so much trouble in getting funds and
ships that it was not till May, 1498, that he could again
set sail, with a fleet of six vessels.</p>

<p>Instead of taking his usual course, Columbus steered
directly westward from the Cape Verde Islands, and
reached Trin-i-dad´ in the middle of the summer. After
visiting that island, he explored the gulf behind it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
came to the mouth of the O-ri-no´co River. From the
great volume of water, he concluded that this river must
flow through an extensive continent, and thought it must
surely be one of the four great streams from the Garden
of Eden!</p>

<p>Although Columbus now felt certain he had finally
reached the mainland of Asia, he could find none of the
rich cities he sought, and sadly went back to Haiti. There
things had been going on worse than ever, for the Spaniards
had mutinied, as well as the natives.</p>

<p>Columbus now forwarded the most disobedient of the
colonists to Spain. But when they got there, they complained
so much about him that the king and queen again
sent out a nobleman to see what was amiss. The Spanish
officer no sooner reached Haiti than he took the command
away from Columbus, who was put in irons and sent back
to Spain to be tried there.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XIV. DEATH OF COLUMBUS.</h2>


<p>Eight years after his first journey across the Atlantic
Columbus returned to Spain a prisoner! The captain
of the vessel wanted to remove his chains, but
Columbus proudly said that as they had been put on by
the orders of his sovereigns, he would wear them until the
king and queen set him free. He also added that he would
keep those chains as long as he lived, and have them
buried with him, so that people might know how unjustly
he had been treated. It is said that the fetters hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
six years over his bed, and that, at his request, they were
placed in his coffin and buried with him.</p>

<p>When Columbus reached Spain the sensation was great.
The people, who had been at first enthusiastic and then
indifferent about him, were now indignant that he should
be treated so unjustly, and when Isabella received a letter,
telling her how he had been insulted, her heart was filled
with pity.</p>

<p>She immediately sent a messenger to remove Columbus's
chains, and summoned him to court, where she wept with
him when she heard him describe his sufferings. But
although Isabella promised that his honors should all be
given back to him, and that she would soon fit out a new
expedition for him, she kept him waiting two long years.</p>

<p>In 1502 Columbus set out on his fourth and last journey,
not as ruler of the new lands, but merely as explorer.
After a stormy passage, he reached the colony at Haiti,
where the governor refused to allow him to land. Columbus
told this man that a tempest was coming up, and
that it would not be safe for any one to leave the port.
But the governor would not believe him, and ordered
some Spanish vessels, which were laden with gold and
ready to start, to set out for Spain.</p>

<p>They no sooner got out of the harbor than the storm
overtook and sorely damaged them. But Columbus, who
had warned them of the danger, safely weathered the
storm, and, sailing on, he explored the coast of Central
America, still seeking a road to India.</p>

<p>Columbus was now old and ill; so after coming to a part
of the coast which he took for the Spice Islands because
he found spices there, and after suffering shipwreck, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
returned to Haiti and thence to Spain. There he soon
heard that Isabella, Queen of Castile (kahs-teel´) and
Le´on (parts of Spain), was dead, and his sorrow at her loss
made his health worse than ever. The Spaniards, knowing
his principal friend was gone, now treated him even
more scornfully than before, and mockingly called him
"Lord of Mosquito Land," because there were so many
mosquitoes along the South American coast.</p>

<p>These insults, added to his disappointment at not finding
India, helped to make Columbus's illness fatal; and
feeling that he was about to die, he wrote his will, leaving
his title of admiral to his son. He passed away in the
month of May, 1506, saying: "Into thy hands, O Lord,
I commend my spirit."</p>

<p>Buried at Valladolid (vahl-yah-dō-leed´), his body was
removed first to Se-ville´, then to San´to Do-min´go, in
Haiti, then to Ha-van´a, in Cuba, and finally, after the
relinquishment of Cuba by Spain in 1898, back to Seville
again. After his death, people began to realize what a
great man Columbus was, and King Ferdinand, who had
been so unkind to him while he lived, put up a monument
in his honor, on which was later inscribed the motto:
"To Castile and Leon Columbus gave a new world."</p>

<p>Since then, many monuments have been erected and
many pictures painted of the man who, in spite of poverty,
illness, and countless obstacles, never gave up his aim, and
manfully strove to reach it as long as he lived. His faith,
his courage, and his perseverance have served as shining
examples for more than four hundred years, and although
he died poor and neglected, he is rightly considered one
of the world's greatest men.</p>

<h2>XV. HOW AMERICA GOT ITS NAME.</h2>


<p>The news of Columbus's first successful journey no
sooner became known in Europe than each country
wanted to secure some share of the profitable trade which
they fancied would soon be opened with India. Henry
VII., King of England, who had refused to listen to Columbus's
plan, now hired a Venetian captain named John
Cab´ot, and sent out an expedition in 1497.</p>

<p>Cabot crossed the Atlantic, and explored what he
thought was China, but what was really part of North
America,&mdash;probably the coast of New´foŭnd-land and of
the mainland from Labrador to Cape Cod. Sailing along,
he found a beautiful country, saw a bear plunge into the
water to catch fish, and, landing at least once, planted an
English flag upon our soil, thus taking formal possession
of it in the name of England.</p>

<p>The next year his son made a similar journey. Sailing
in and out of every bay, he sought a strait which
would take him past these wild lands to the rich cities of
the East, which he fancied were very near there. Of
course he failed to find such a strait between Nova Scotia
and Cape Hat´ter-as, but the English later claimed all this
part of the country, because it had been discovered by
the Cabots. Still, for many years they made no attempt
to plant a colony there, and prized their discovery so little
that Henry VII. gave Cabot only £10 reward for all he
had done.</p>

<p>The Portuguese, as we have seen, were very jealous
when Columbus came back from his first journey, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he had found the road to India. But while he was away
on his third expedition, one of their captains, Vasco da
Gama (vahs´co dah gah´mah), sailing all around Africa and
across the Indian Ocean, reached Cal´i-cut in India. He
came home in 1499, with a rich cargo of silks and spices;
and the Portuguese rejoiced greatly that they were the
first to reach India by sea.</p>

<p>The next year some Portuguese ships, on their way
around Africa, happened to go so far west that they sighted
the coast of South America. Spain and Portugal had by
this time drawn a line of demarcation on the map, agreeing
that all lands west of it should belong to Spain,
and all east to Portugal. As the new land was east of
this line, the King of Portugal sent a fleet to explore it,
and thus found it was a great continent. All the lands
already discovered by the Spanish and English were supposed
to form part of Asia; but this land was so far south
that it was called the New World.</p>

<p>The pilot of the Portuguese fleet was a young Italian
named A-mer´i-cus Ves-pu´cius. He took note of all he
saw, and wrote an interesting account of his voyage. This
narrative described the country, and as every one wanted
to hear about the new discovery, it was soon published.
A German geographer, reading the account of Americus,
was so delighted with it that he suggested that the new
continent should be named America, in honor of the man
who had explored and described it so well. The name was
thus given at first only to part of South America; but
when, years afterwards, it was found that all the western
lands belonged to the same continent, the whole of the
New World was called America. Thus, by an accident, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
country bears the name of Americus, instead of that of
Columbus, its real discoverer, for it was the latter who
showed the way to it, although he believed till his death
that he had found only a new road to Asia.</p>

<p>Many writers claim that the first voyage of Americus
to the West was in 1497, four years before his exploration of
South America, and that he then landed on the American
continent, shortly before Cabot, and more than a year before
Columbus reached the mainland. According to them,
Americus was thus the first to reach the continent which
bears his name.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XVI. THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.</h2>


<p>The Spaniards, as we have seen, immediately began
planting colonies in the West Indies, and in a few
years they took possession of all the islands, and made
the natives their slaves. These poor creatures were
forced to work hard for their new masters, who, thirsting
for gold, made them wash the sands of all their streams,
and toil without ceasing.</p>

<p>The Spaniards in Cuba and Haiti, hearing many tales
of the gold to be found in the west, soon sent out several
expeditions. They also planted a few colonies along the
coast of Central America, but at first these did not thrive.</p>

<p>Among the colonists in Haiti there was a Spaniard
named Bal-bo´a. He was poor but very daring, and
wished to join an expedition bound for the mainland. As
he could not pay for his passage, he hid in a cask and had
himself carried on board ship as freight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>When far out at sea Balboa crept out of his hiding
place, won the captain's forgiveness, and soon made so
many friends that he became a leader in the settlement
they founded on the Isthmus of Da´ri-en, or Pan-a-ma´.
After a time he learned from the natives that a great ocean
lay on the other side of the ridge of mountains. He therefore
made his way through the tangled underbrush and
rank tropical growth, bidding his men wait at the foot of
the mountain, while he climbed up alone.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p063.jpg" width="450" height="428" alt="balboa" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Balboa Discovers the South Sea.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching the top, he gazed southward and beheld a
great stretch of water, which he called the Great South
Sea (1513). Falling down upon his knees, he gave thanks
to God, and then made joyful signs to his followers to
come up and join him.</p>

<p>Accompanied by these men, Balboa next went down
the opposite slope, and, reaching the shore, waded out into
the ocean, with a flag in one hand and his drawn sword
in the other. Standing thus in the waters of the Great
South Sea, he took possession of it in the name of Spain,
declaring that all the countries it bathed belonged to his
sovereigns.</p>

<p>That same year one of the former companions of Columbus,
Pōnce de Leon, started out from Puerto Rico
(pwĕr´tō re´co). Like many other men of his time, he
believed that all the stories he had heard were true, and
that somewhere in the world there was a magic spring
called the Fountain of Youth. He thought that if one
drank of its waters, or bathed in them, one would be sure
to become young again, and as he was rapidly growing
old he longed to find and try it.</p>

<p>After vainly seeking the fountain on the newly discovered
islands, he fancied, from what the natives told
him, that it might be situated on the mainland, so he set
out in quest of it. On Easter Sunday (<i>Pascua florida</i>),
he landed in a beautiful country, which, in honor of the
day, he called Florida. After taking possession of it for
Spain, he began exploring; but although he drank from
every spring, and bathed in every stream, he could not
find the Fountain of Youth, and kept growing older and
older.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>After several years he made another journey to Florida,
to continue his search, and to make a settlement; but as
there were no roads through the dense forests and treacherous
marshes, he and his men suffered greatly from
hunger and heat. Finally Ponce de Leon was sorely
wounded in a fight with the Indians, and his men carried
him back to Cuba. There he died, a wrinkled old man,
still regretting that he had not been able to find the
Fountain of Youth. His friends, who admired his bravery,
and often said he was as bold as his namesake the lion,
wrote upon his tomb: "In this sepulcher rest the bones
of a man who was Leon [lion] by name and still more by
nature."</p>

<p>While Ponce de Leon was seeking the magic fountain,
some of his countrymen were exploring the Gulf coast,
from Florida to Mexico, under the leadership of Pineda
(pe-nā´da). In 1519, also, a Portuguese, named Ma-gel´lan,
took a Spanish fleet down the coast of South America.
After a time he came to the strait bearing his name, and,
sailing through it, beheld the Great South Sea.</p>

<p>Magellan was such a brave seaman that he steered boldly
across this unknown expanse of water. It was so much
smoother than the Atlantic that he called it the Pacific, or
"Peaceful" Ocean, a name which it has borne ever since,
and which suits it much better than the one given by
Balboa. After a journey of a year and a half, Magellan
finally reached the Phil´ip-pĭne Islands, where he was killed
in a fight with the natives.</p>

<p>One of his officers now took command, and went on till
he reached India. Thence, by way of the Cape of Good
Hope, he came to Spain, sailing for the first time all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
around the globe. Besides proving that the earth is round,
this voyage showed that South America is separated from
India by a great stretch of water. Magellan's journey took
three years, but now, thanks to steamboats and railroads,
it can be made in about two months.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XVII. "THE FATHER OF WATERS."</h2>


<p>The year 1519 was eventful for the Spanish. In that
year Magellan started out on his journey around the
world, Pineda explored the Gulf coast, and Cor´tez,&mdash;a
very brave Spaniard,&mdash;landing at Vera Cruz (vā´rah
croos), marched into the country and took Mexico, the
city of a great Indian chief named Mon-te-zu´ma.</p>

<p>Although Cortez had only five hundred men, and the
Indians were very numerous, he soon became master of
the whole country, which belonged to Spain for many a
year. The Indians in Mexico were partly civilized, and
the region was rich in gold and precious stones. Another
Spaniard, named Pi-zar´ro, shortly after conquered Pe-ru´,
and owing to the cargoes of gold constantly sent from
Mexico, Peru, and other parts of the newly discovered lands,
Spain soon became the wealthiest country in Europe.</p>

<p>Although the Spaniards were anxious to grow rich, they
also wished to convert the natives. Besides soldiers and
colonists, therefore, every vessel brought out priests to
convert the heathen. These men were very good, and so
fearless that they went everywhere, preaching and teaching
with great zeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>They tried to learn the natives' language, and often
questioned the people about the country. All that they
heard they repeated to their leaders, who, finding there
was much gold in the northwest, resolved to go in search
of it. A party headed by Narvaez (nar-vah´eth) set out,
therefore, to explore and conquer the northern coast of
the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>But Narvaez was very unfortunate. While he was inland
his ships sailed on, and when he came back to the
shore they were out of sight. Painfully making his way
along through the tangled woods for many miles, he finally
reached the coast again and built a second fleet. This,
however, was wrecked at the mouth of the Mississippi
("The Father of Waters"), where Narvaez was drowned.</p>

<p>Four of the followers of Narvaez, narrowly escaping
death, soon after fell into the hands of the Indians. By
pretending to be magicians, these men made the Indians
fear them. They lived eight years among various savage
tribes, wandering all across the continent to the Gulf of
Cal-i-for´ni-a, and finally came back to Mexico, where
their leader, Cabeza de Vaca (cah-bā´sah dā vah´cah), told
their adventures to the Spaniards. He was the first
European to visit the region between the Mississippi and
California, and it is said that he tramped more than ten
thousand miles during those eight years of captivity.</p>

<p>The tales told by Vaca and his companions made the
Spaniards long to visit the country and find the Seven
Cities of Cibola (see´bo-lah), where they fancied they could
secure much gold. A priest named Mar´cōs therefore
set out to question and convert the natives. Taking
one of Vaca's companions, a negro servant, as guide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Marcos wandered on foot into New Mexico, where he saw
from afar seven Zuñi (zoo´nyee) pueblos, or villages.</p>

<p>Hearing from the Indians that these were the Seven
Cities of Cibola, he went back to report what he had seen.
A Spaniard named Coronado (co-ro-nah´tho) now set out
with an army of about two hundred and fifty men. He
made his way into the new country, visited the Cibola
pueblos, and hearing wonderful tales of Acoma (ah´co-ma),
a city built in the skies, set out to find it. After many
hardships, he and his little army came into a wide valley,
in the center of which rose a huge rock, with straight sides
more than three hundred feet high, and with a broad flat
top of about seventy acres.</p>

<p>On the top of this rock the Indians had built one of
their cliff dwellings, which they reached by narrow rocky
stairways. Coronado visited this strange city, but finding
the people poor, and hearing there was gold farther
north, he pressed on, and even came to the Grand Canyon
of the Col-o-ra´do.</p>

<p>While Coronado was thus exploring much of the southwestern
part of our country, another Spaniard, De So´to,&mdash;who
had helped conquer Peru,&mdash;set out from Cuba
with nine vessels and an army of nearly a thousand men.
He landed in Tam´pa Bay, and, searching for gold, wandered
for three years through the forests of Florida,
Geor´gi-a, Al-a-ba´ma, and Mississippi. Often attacked
by hostile Indians, and suffering greatly from hunger and
sickness, he nevertheless reached the Mississippi River, and
crossed it near Lower Chick´a-saw Bluffs.</p>

<p>But he could not find the El Do-ra´do, or "Land of Gold,"
he was seeking, and after exploring the region between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the Missouri and the Red rivers, and losing many men,
he resolved to turn back. Before long, however, De Soto
died of malaria (1541), and the Spaniards, after secretly
burying him, told the Indians he had gone on a long
journey. But when they saw that the savages did not
believe them, and gazed suspiciously at the upturned soil,
they began to fear the Indians would treat De Soto's
remains shamefully.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">De Soto's First View of the Mississippi.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the middle of the night, therefore, they took their
dead leader up out of his grave, and wrapped him in a
cloak weighted with sand. Then, rowing out into the
Mississippi, they noiselessly lowered his body into the
middle of the great stream which he had been the first
European to visit since the Spaniards were shipwrecked
at its mouth in 1519.</p>

<p>His little army, after making a desperate attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
retrace its way overland, came back to the Mississippi.
Here the Spaniards built huge rafts, and, floating down
the stream, reached its mouth at the end of nineteen days.
Then, coasting along the Gulf, they made their way to a
Mexican settlement, where they told the story of all their
adventures during this long search for gold.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XVIII. THE FRENCH IN CANADA.</h2>


<p>Columbus had been dead for nearly fifty years,
and yet people were only just beginning to explore
that part of the New World which is occupied by our
country. But the coast of South America was quite well
known by this time, and already clearly outlined on maps,
while North America was still a mystery.</p>

<p>Most people still fancied that North America was only
a narrow strip of land, like Central America. They also
thought that somewhere north of the Gulf of Mexico there
must be a strait, by means of which it would be easy to
pass into the Pacific Ocean, and thereby reach India without
taking the long journey all around South America.</p>

<p>The navigators who visited the coast of North America
in search of this strait, spoke, on their return, of the great
quantities of fish they had seen. Even the Cabots had found
many fish there. Now, all the Christian people in western
Europe were Roman Catholics in those days, and so ate
fish instead of meat on fast days, which were so many
that they took up about one third of the time. Fish was
therefore in great demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>As the rivers did not supply enough, fishing soon became
a paying trade for those who lived by the sea; and because
many fish were found on the coasts of Brit´ta-ny, in France,
the Bret´on fishermen did a good business. Still, when
they heard of great schools of codfish on the Banks of
Newfoundland, which could be caught and salted very
easily, these bold fishermen were anxious to secure them.
They therefore began to make fishing trips across the
Atlantic, and before long gave their name to Cape
Breton.</p>

<p>France and Spain often waged costly wars, and seeing
that the Spaniards received much gold from the New World,
the French longed to have some of it, too. Their king,
therefore, said that he had as good a right to any undiscovered
land as the Spaniards, and that the latter should
not be allowed to keep the New World all to themselves.</p>

<p>Next, he sent out an expedition under Verrazano (ver-rah-tsah´no),
who explored the coast of North America
from what is now North Car-o-li´na to Newfoundland.
Some historians say that this captain finally fell into the
hands of cannibal Indians, who devoured him in the sight
of his helpless crew; but others declare that Verrazano
was caught by the Spaniards during a war with France,
and hanged as a pirate.</p>

<p>The French were not discouraged, however. A few
years after the death of Verrazano they sent out another
expedition, in charge of Cartier (car-tyā´). After sailing
nearly all the way around Newfoundland, this explorer,
in 1534, came to the mainland, set up a huge wooden
cross, and took possession of the country, in the name
of France. The next year he came back, and, sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
up the St. Lawrence River, gave it that name because it
was Saint Lawrence's day in the calendar. He visited
the place where Que-bec´ now stands, and went on up
the stream until he came to an Indian village, composed
of several long houses surrounded by a palisade.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p072.jpg" width="450" height="345" alt="niagara" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Niagara Falls.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Near this village there was a hill which Cartier climbed,
and when his eyes rested upon the beautiful view at his
feet, he exclaimed that this was truly a Mont-re-al´, or
royal mountain. A city built some time after on this very
spot still bears the name he gave the place.</p>

<p>After spending a short time on the St. Lawrence, Cartier
went back to France, taking several Indians with him.
Some of these savages died, and when Cartier returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
without them, and tried to establish a colony, he had
trouble with their relatives. Cartier gave the name of
Can´a-da to part of the country, and in talking with the
Indians learned that far inland there was a huge waterfall,
whose roar could be heard many miles away. Indeed,
some of the Indians called it Ni-ag´a-ra, which in English
means "The Thunder of Waters."</p>

<p>Although Cartier longed to see this wonder, he had no
time to visit it, and as the climate proved too cold for his
men, he went back to France, saying it would not be
possible to plant a colony so far north. For the next few
years, therefore, the French had only a few trading posts
along the St. Lawrence River, where the Indians came at
certain times to exchange the furs of the animals they had
killed for the beads and trinkets they loved so well.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XIX. FRENCH AND SPANISH QUARRELS.</h2>


<p>Twenty years passed by before the French again
attempted to plant a colony in America&mdash;twenty very
eventful years for France and for all western Europe.
The people, who, as you have heard, had all been Roman
Catholics for centuries, now began to divide. Some of
them refused to obey the pope, and wanted to worship in
a somewhat different way. In France these people were
called Hu´gue-nots, and among them was a nobleman
named Coligny (co-leen´ye).</p>

<p>Seeing that the Huguenots were much disliked in
their own country, Coligny proposed that they should go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the New World and found a colony where they could
worship as they pleased without offending any one. As
Cartier said the climate was too cold in Canada, Coligny
sent the Huguenots farther south, in charge of Laudonnière
(lo-do-ne-ār´) and Ribault (re-bo´).</p>

<p>The French colonists, landing in the New World, called
the country Carolina, in honor of their king, Charles, and
they also gave this name to their fort. But they soon
lacked food and became discouraged. As the vessel in
which they had come had sailed away, they built a new
ship and set out for France. At sea, lack of provisions
soon brought them to such desperate straits that they
drew lots and ate one of their number. In fact, had they
not been taken prisoners by an English ship, it is very
likely they would all have died of hunger.</p>

<p>Two years later another French settlement of the same
name was made in Florida, on the St. Johns River. As
soon as the colonists were comfortably settled, Ribault
went off to punish some Spaniards for attacking his fleet in
time of peace. But while he was away the Spaniards came
by land to surprise the Huguenot settlement.</p>

<p>Now, you must know that the Spaniards were ardent
Roman Catholics, and believed that all Huguenots were
very wicked people. Besides, they hated the French,
with whom they had often been at war, and claimed
Florida as their own land because Ponce de Leon had
visited it first. They were so sure, therefore, that they
were doing right by killing the French Huguenots, that
when the massacre was all over, their leader, Menendez
(mā-nen´deth) put up a sign on a tree near by, saying
that he had slain the colonists, not because they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Frenchmen, but because they were not good Catholics.
This done, Menendez went back to the colony of St.
Au´gus-tine, which he had founded two years before (1565)
in Florida. This is the oldest city on the mainland of
the United States, and it still proudly bears the name
given by Menendez, its Spanish founder.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p075.jpg" width="450" height="333" alt="mission" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Old Spanish Mission at St. Augustine.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The news of the massacre of the Huguenot colonists
was received with great indignation in France. As the
king would take no steps to avenge it, a nobleman named
De Gourgues (goorg) fitted out an expedition at his own
expense, and attacked the Spaniards on the St. Johns.
He came upon them unawares, and killed them all, as they
had murdered the Huguenots at the same place. Then he
placed a sign above the heads of the men he had hanged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
saying they had been executed, not because they were
Spaniards, but because they were pirates and murderers.
De Gourgues then sailed away, for the Spaniards had so
strong a fort at St. Augustine that the French had given
up all hope of settling in Florida.</p>

<p>Four years after founding St. Augustine, the Spaniards
planted the colony of San Diego in California, which,
however, was soon abandoned. Their next colony was
started many years later at Santa Fé (fā´), in New Mexico,
and thence many priests went out to build mission stations
in the West and convert the Indians.</p>

<p>The present city of Santa Fé, the oldest town in
the western United States, was founded in 1598 by a
Spaniard named Oñate (ōn-yah´tā), who had married the
granddaughter of Cortez, conqueror of Mexico. This
Oñate had helped the Spaniards conquer Peru. He was
a very brave man, and hearing about the "Sky City" of
Acoma, he resolved to visit it. About fifty years after
Coronado, therefore, he came within sight of the strange
town perched upon a rock.</p>

<p>The Indians, who by this time had learned to fear and
hate the Spaniards, thought this would be a good chance
to kill their greatest foe. So they invited Oñate up into
their city, and showed him their cisterns and granaries.
Then, taking him to the top of one of their great houses,
they bade him step down through an open trapdoor into
a dark chamber.</p>

<p>Oñate, suspecting treachery, refused to enter, and it
was well for him that he did so, for a number of armed
Indians were lurking there in the darkness, ready to kill
the Spaniards as soon as they set foot in the apartment.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<h2>XX. THE SKY CITY.</h2>


<p>Although Oñate cleverly escaped being murdered
by the Indians in Acoma, another Spanish captain,
Zaldivar (thahl-de´var), was less fortunate, a short time after.
He and half his force imprudently ventured up on the rock;
but instead of staying together, as Oñate's troops had done,
they scattered to view the strange place. The Indians
took advantage of this to pounce upon their unsuspecting
guests, at a given signal, and began killing them.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, clad in armor, defended themselves
heroically; but many fell, and the last five were driven to
the very edge of the rock and forced to jump down. But,
strange to relate, only one of these men was killed. The
others fell into a heap of fine sand, which the wind had
piled up against the base of the great rock.</p>

<p>These men were promptly rescued by their comrades,
who, knowing this attempt would be followed by a general
attack upon all the missions, hastened back to warn Oñate
of his peril. After taking immediate measures to protect
the priests, Oñate sent a force of seventy men, under Zaldivar's
brother, to punish the people of Acoma.</p>

<p>The Indians, warned of the Spaniards' coming, closely
guarded their rocky staircases. When the second Zaldivar
summoned them to surrender, they mocked him, bade their
medicine men curse him, and flung showers of arrows and
stones down upon him. The Spaniards, unable to reach
their foes, were obliged to take refuge under the overhanging
rock to escape the missiles hurled down upon
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>All night long they heard the shrieks of the Indians.
They were holding a monster war dance overhead, and
fiercely illustrating the tortures they meant to make the
Spaniards suffer the next day. This prospect, however,
did not frighten Zaldivar's brave men, and while their foes
shouted and danced, they made a clever plan to surprise
the city.</p>

<p>Early the next day, Zaldivar and part of his force pretended
to storm the north side of the rock. But while
they were thus engaging the attention of the Indians,
twelve of their number slowly crawled up a neighboring
pinnacle of rock, dragging a small cannon after them. No
one noticed what they were doing, and it was only when
the cannon was in place, and the first stone ball came
crashing into the adobe houses, that the Indians perceived
their danger.</p>

<p>The rock upon which the Spaniards had planted their
cannon was on a level with Acoma, separated from it by
a chasm only a few feet wide but about three hundred
feet deep. From this point the Spaniards shot ball after
ball into the town. When night came on, they crept down
again, cut several trees, dragged the trunks up to the top
of their rock, and at dawn flung one of them across the
abyss.</p>

<p>In spite of a hail of stones and arrows hurled by the
Indians, twelve Spaniards rushed boldly across this dizzy
bridge before the log was accidentally jerked out of place
by one of their number. Cut off from their companions,
and unable to retreat, these brave men were now in great
danger, for they had to face all those raging savages alone.</p>

<p>Seeing their peril, one of their comrades drew back as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
far as he could on the outlying rock, and rushing forward
took a flying leap across the chasm! By great good fortune
he landed safely on the other side, drew the log into
place once more, and thus enabled the other Spaniards to
cross with their cannon.</p>

<p>One house after another was now battered down, and at
the end of three days' hard fighting the Spaniards were complete
masters of the Sky City of Acoma. But they soon
left it, and many years later, when Fray Ramirez (rah-me´reth),
a Spanish priest, came thither and began climbing
the staircase, the Indians tried to keep him away by flinging
a shower of stones down upon him.</p>

<p>Spanish priests, however, were ready to risk everything
for the sake of their religion, so Fray Ramirez calmly
continued to climb up. In the general excitement a little
Indian girl drew too near to the edge of the rock, and,
losing her balance, fell over! Although her people fancied
she had fallen to the ground and been killed, she had
only dropped to a narrow ledge, where they could not see
her. Fray Ramirez, looking upward, saw the accident.
Climbing carefully along the ledge, he picked up the little
maiden, and soon reappeared on the staircase, carrying
her on his shoulder.</p>

<p>The Indians, believing the child dead, now cried out
that this was a miracle, and suddenly ceased throwing
stones. When the priest reached the plateau they ran to
meet him, listened quietly to his teachings, and even built
a church in Acoma under his directions. And it is in
memory of his coming among them that the stone stairway
of Acoma is still known as the "Path of the Father."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXI. AROUND THE WORLD.</h2>


<p>After the voyages of the Cabots in 1497-1498, the
English for some time took little interest in the New
World. But in the middle of the sixteenth century several
noted seamen visited America. One of these men
was Hawkins, who brought over from Africa a cargo of
negroes. He sold these as slaves to the Spaniards in the
West Indies.</p>

<p>Until then prisoners of war had often been sold as
slaves, and the Indians on the newly discovered islands
had, as we have seen, found cruel taskmasters in the
colonists. But as these savages were not used to hard
work, they soon died.</p>

<p>Hawkins fancied he was doing a very wise thing in
bringing negroes over from Africa to replace them. Indeed,
he was so proud of this idea that he had a slave
painted on his coat of arms, and said, like Columbus, that
it was much better for the negroes to be slaves among
Christians than free among heathens.</p>

<p>It was thus that the negro slave trade began, and for
two hundred and fifty years slave ships plied to and fro
across the Atlantic Ocean, bringing over countless colored
people, who were sold first to the Spaniards and later to
the Americans.</p>

<p>The English were so anxious to discover a northwest
passage to India (that is, a way to sail through or around
the northern part of America) that they sent Frob´ish-er
out to search for it in 1576. He sailed northward until
he came to the bay which still bears his name. He landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
there, and, to his delight, found some yellow ore, which he
carried home. This was what is now known as fool's
gold, or pyrites; but the English, thinking it was real gold,
quickly sent out a ship to bring home a whole cargo of
the worthless stuff.</p>

<p>Some time after this visit of Frobisher's, Da´vis sailed
still farther north, only to be driven back by the ice in the
strait which still bears his name. Although he did not
know it, Davis had discovered the entrance to the long-sought
northwest passage; but it could never be used to
reach Asia, as people hoped, on account of the great
icebergs which block it up nearly all the year.</p>

<p>Another great English seaman of this time was Francis
Drake, who first sailed with the slave trader Hawkins.
When he came to the Spanish settlements in the West
Indies and Mexico, and saw how much gold was shipped
to Spain, he wanted to get some of it for his country, too.
He therefore set out with several vessels, and although
war had not yet been declared between England and
Spain, he boldly attacked the Spanish colonies and ships,
and secured much booty.</p>

<p>When war broke out Drake became more daring than
ever, and running unexpectedly into the Spanish ports,
he began plundering. Then, setting fire to the shipping,
he sailed off again, after thus "singeing the King of
Spain's beard," as he called it. During one of his many
journeys, Drake landed on the Isthmus of Panama, where,
climbing the mountains, he was the first Englishman to
behold the Pacific Ocean, about fifty years after it had
been seen by Balboa.</p>

<p>In the course of his piratical expeditions Drake sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
through the Strait of Magellan into the Pacific Ocean,
and, after securing much booty from the Spaniards in
Peru, coasted about until he came to the Californian bay
which still bears his name. He called this part of the
country New Al´bi-on, and made such friends with the
Indians there that they invited him to stay and be their
king.</p>

<p>But Drake was anxious to carry his treasures home;
and as he knew a Spanish fleet was lying in wait for him
near the Strait of Magellan, he boldly crossed the Pacific,
and went back by way of the Cape of Good Hope. He
was thus, as he said, the first Englishman
who "plowed a furrow
around the globe." Queen E-liz´a-beth
was so proud of this fact
that she knighted Drake on board
of his own ship, the <i>Pelican</i>, and
graciously accepted all the stolen
jewels he gave her (1580).</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Pelican Chair.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Pelican</i> was carefully preserved
for about one hundred
years, and when it fell to pieces a
chair was made from its timbers,
and given to the Oxford University,
where it can still be seen.
As for Drake, he lived to continue his journeys some time
longer, and to take part in the great naval battle against
the Spanish Ar-ma´da; and he finally perished while on
his way to make an attack on the West Indies.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXII. NOTHING BUT SMOKE.</h2>


<p>The greatest of all the English seamen of this time
was Sir Walter Raleigh (raw´ly). A poet, philosopher,
historian, courtier, and colonizer, Raleigh was also
a favorite of Queen Elizabeth. We are told that he won
this lady's approval by once spreading his new cloak on
the ground so that she might pass dry-shod over a muddy
spot.</p>

<p>Raleigh's great ambition was to "plant an English nation
in America." He and his half-brother, Sir Humphrey
Gil´bert, therefore obtained Elizabeth's permission to
start a colony in any part of the New World not yet
occupied by any other Christian power. Then Gilbert
started across the Atlantic with several ships and took
possession of Newfoundland. While cruising near there,
one of his vessels was wrecked.</p>

<p>On his return voyage his little fleet was overtaken by a
storm. Gilbert was on a leaky vessel, but as the other
ships were not large enough to contain all his men, he
refused to leave it for a safer one. When they told him
that he was in great danger, he quietly answered, "Heaven
is as near by water as by land," and calmly went on reading
his Bible. The storm increased. All at once the other
boats missed the light of Gilbert's ship! They peered anxiously
out into the darkness, but all in vain, for the vessel
had sunk with its brave captain and all its crew.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus_p084.jpg" width="600" height="397" alt="queen" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Undaunted by this first failure, Raleigh soon sent out a
new expedition. It brought back such favorable reports
of the coast farther south that Raleigh named the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a><br /><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Virgin´i-a, in honor of Elizabeth, the virgin (or unmarried)
queen, who gave him a grant of land there.</p>

<p>Among other strange things, Raleigh's explorers brought
back potatoes, which had never yet been seen in England.
Raleigh planted these on his estate in Ireland, where
people were at first afraid to eat them, lest they should be
poisonous. Before long, however, potatoes became so
common that they have been the chief food of the Irish
peasants for many a year.</p>

<p>The first colony established by Raleigh, on Ro-a-noke´
Island, in what is now North Carolina, suffered many
hardships. The people were so discouraged by the time
Drake came to visit them, that they persuaded him to
carry them back to England. Then a second colony was
started on the same spot, which thus became the home of
the first little English baby born in our country. She
was called Virginia, in honor of her birthplace.</p>

<p>A war with Spain prevented Raleigh's sending supplies
to this colony for several years, and when the grandfather
of the first English-American child finally visited Roanoke,
little Virginia had vanished, as well as all the rest of the
colonists. No one has ever known what became of them,
but it is supposed that they were all killed by the Indians.
The only trace ever found was one word carved on a big
tree, the name of the neighboring village of Croa-tan´.</p>

<p>These ventures, and his many journeys, made Raleigh
so poor that he finally had to give up all his rights to
the land.</p>

<p>As we have seen, Raleigh was a great favorite of the
queen, therefore many stories are told about him. For
instance, it is related that he was the first Englishman to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
use tobacco, which the Indians said "cured being tired."
One day, when Raleigh was smoking in his room, a new
servant came in with a pitcher of water. Seeing smoke
come out of his master's mouth and nose, the man fancied
that Raleigh was on fire, and hastily upset the water on his
head to put out the flames!</p>

<p>We are also told that Raleigh taught Queen Elizabeth
how to smoke, and that they two enjoyed many a pipe
together. On one occasion Raleigh made a bet with the
queen that he could tell the exact weight of the smoke
from her pipe. First he carefully weighed the tobacco
she put in her pipe; then, when she was through smoking,
he weighed the ashes, and won his wager by telling her that
the difference in weight between tobacco and ashes was
that of the smoke! Elizabeth paid the money cheerfully,
but remarked that, while she had often heard of turning
gold into smoke, he was the first who had turned smoke
into gold.</p>

<p>About twenty years after Raleigh founded his first
colony, another English seaman, named Gos´nold, decided
that it was very foolish to take the roundabout way by
Iceland or the Azores Islands to reach America. He
therefore boldly steered straight across the Atlantic, thus
shortening the trip by about one thousand miles.</p>

<p>The first land he saw he named Cape Cod, because he
found so many codfish there. Soon after he stopped on
Cut´ty-hunk Island, near the coast, where he built a house.
Then, after securing a cargo of sassafras, which was at
that time used as a medicine for almost every disease,
Gosnold sailed home, leaving his house tenantless.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXIII. SMITH'S ADVENTURES.</h2>


<p>Sir Walter Raleigh was in favor as long as
Elizabeth lived, but when she died he was accused of
treason and put in prison by James I. While in his cell this
brave man wrote a history of the world for young Prince
Henry, who often visited him, and longed to free him. He
once said: "Only such a king as my father would keep such
a bird in such a cage." The same monarch finally ordered
Raleigh to be put to death. Mounting the scaffold, the
prisoner asked to see the ax, and, running his finger along
its edge to test its keenness, said: "This is a sharp medicine,
but a cure for all evils."</p>

<p>Before going to prison Raleigh had given up all his
claims in America to English merchants. They formed
two bodies, the London Company and the Plym´oŭth Company,
and persuaded the king to give each of them a
piece of land in North America one hundred miles square.</p>

<p>This matter being decided, the London Company sent
out a shipload of settlers, who, in 1607, sailed into Ches´a-peake
Bay. They called the capes on either side Charles
and Henry, in honor of the two princes; then, passing up
a river, they landed on a marshy cape, where they founded
the first lasting English colony in the United States.
River and town were both named after King James, who
had selected their officers and made their laws.</p>

<p>The James´town colonists were nearly all gentlemen,
who had come without their families because they intended
to stay only long enough to get rich. As there were only
four carpenters among them, these men were kept very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
busy. But, instead of building comfortable houses, and
plowing and sowing, the rest of the settlers spent all their
time looking for gold. The result was that their supplies
gave out, and as the Indians were unfriendly and would
not give them food, they were soon in danger of starving.
Besides, Jamestown was on low, damp ground, and the
water was so bad that the ill-fed people suffered from
malaria, and about half of them died.</p>

<p>Among the Englishmen who had come to Virginia there
was Captain John Smith. This man had been a soldier, had
traveled a great deal, and had visited France, Italy, and
E´gypt.</p>

<p>We are told that while he was on his way to Egypt
a great storm once overtook his ship. The pilgrims on
the vessel cried out that there must be a wrongdoer, or a
Jonah, among them, and in their terror proposed to draw
lots. Finding out thus that Smith was the guilty person,
they hastily pitched him overboard. But although there
was no whale to swallow him, Smith managed to swim
ashore, and some time later, longing for more adventures,
he went to fight in Hun´ga-ry.</p>

<p>Here he declared that the teachings of Christ were far
better than those of Mo-ham´med, and offered to prove it
by fighting three Turks. He killed them all, but, being
wounded, was soon made a prisoner and sold as a slave.
One day, when Smith was threshing in the field, his cruel
taskmaster beat him severely, although he had done
nothing wrong. Indignant at this unjust treatment,
Smith suddenly raised his flail, and struck the Turk such
a hard blow that the man fell to the ground dead.</p>

<p>Seeing a chance to escape, Smith now quickly exchanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
clothes with the dead man, hid the latter's body
under the straw, filled a bag with corn, and jumping on
a horse rode rapidly away across the plains. After many
days of hard riding, he came to a place where his chains
were struck off, and thence continued his journey home.</p>

<p>After several other journeys and adventures, Smith
joined the newly formed London Company, proposing to
go out himself with the colonists. On the way to Virginia
he was falsely accused of crime, and nearly hanged;
but when he reached land his innocence was proved, and
he soon became the leading spirit of Jamestown.</p>

<p>Through all the sickness and famine Smith alone seemed
brave and strong. Hoping to secure food for the
colonists, he once set out to find the Indians and trade
with them for corn. But at the approach of the English,
we are told that the savages ran away in such haste that
they left their dinner on the fire. The colonists, drawing
near, saw that the Indians had been roasting oysters, and,
tasting them for the first time in their lives, were delighted
to discover a new and delicious kind of food. After
shooting a few turkeys, the English overtook these Indians,
from whom they managed to get quite a supply of corn in
exchange for trinkets and a copper kettle.</p>

<p>In another expedition Captain Smith was surprised by
the Indians while he stood in a marsh, picking berries.
He seized one of the savages and held him fast, using him
as a shield against the arrows of the rest until surrounded
and made a prisoner.</p>

<p>Instead of showing anger or resisting, Smith now followed
his captors quietly, allowing them to touch and examine
him as much as they pleased. He also tried to interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
them by showing them his compass and explaining its use.
Besides, he made friends with the Indian children and
whittled playthings for them. All the prettiest ones, however,
were set aside for Po-ca-hon´tas, the twelve-year-old
daughter of the Indian chief Pow-ha-tan´; and it seems
she was specially pleased with the wooden doll he made
for her.</p>

</div>

<p>We are told that Pocahontas soon grew very fond of
Captain Smith, and that when the Indians once tried to
kill him, she stood between him and their raised tomahawks,
pleading so hard for his life that her father declared
the white man should not be slain. But this story is also
told of several other explorers, and we do not know if it
is quite true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXIV. THE JAMESTOWN MEN.</h2>


<p>After several weeks of captivity Captain Smith bargained
with the Indians to set him free, in exchange
for a certain number of trinkets and one of the bright
brass cannons they had seen at Jamestown. This settled,
he wrote a letter to the colonists, telling them what trinkets
they were to give the bearers, and warning them to
be sure to shoot off the cannon in the Indians' presence,
so that they should not dare carry it off.</p>

<p>Having finished his letter, Smith gave it to his captors,
bidding them take it to Jamestown. He added that it
would tell the English what they wanted, and that they
would hear the big noise which came out of the bright log
(cannon) they coveted. All this, of course, seemed very
mysterious to people who did not know how to write, so
they set out for Jamestown full of curiosity.</p>

<p>When they saw that the white men, after looking at the
letter, gave them all the trinkets they had bargained for,
they were amazed. Then they tried to lift the bright log,
and were surprised at its weight. Motioning them aside,
the colonists next shot off the cannon. The loud noise, and
the fact that the cannon ball splintered a good-sized tree,
filled the Indians with such terror that, as Smith had
foreseen, they refused to touch it again. When they got
back to their camp they let Captain Smith go, and he bade
a friendly good-by to the red men, from whom he had
learned all he could during his short sojourn in their
midst.</p>

<p>Free once more, Captain Smith used all his energies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
get enough grain for his friends; but had it not been for
the Indian girl Pocahontas the colonists would probably
have starved to death. Several times, in the course of that
first hard winter, she brought them game and corn, and,
thanks to her pleading, her father Powhatan became quite
friendly, and supplied their most pressing needs.</p>

<p>In 1608 more colonists came over to Jamestown in
search of gold; but they, too, were gentlemen, and intended
to remain only a short time. They unfortunately
discovered some pyrites, and in spite of all Captain Smith
could say, there was "no talk, no hope, no work, but dig
gold, wash gold, refine gold, load gold." The result was
that the vessel in which they had come was sent home
laden with worthless dirt, instead of carrying a cargo of
lumber, sassafras, or furs, which could have been sold in
England for considerable money.</p>

<p>The only man who did not share this thirst for gold
was Captain Smith. He continued his explorations, and
made a complete map of Chesapeake Bay to send back
to England. Then, the governor having sailed away with
the fool's gold, and the others having proved bad managers,
Smith was soon chosen to be head of the colony.</p>

<p>He began his work by making a few very strict rules,
which all the colonists had to obey. The fine English
gentlemen, who had spent their time playing bowls in the
streets of Jamestown, priding themselves upon never having
done any labor, were now told that if they would not
work they should not eat.</p>

<p>To stop the constant swearing in which these men
freely indulged, Captain Smith next ordered that a canful
of cold water should be poured down any offender's sleeve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
This soon put an end to profanity, and by the time a third
set of colonists reached Jamestown it was quite an orderly
community.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p093.jpg" width="450" height="388" alt="crowning" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Crowning Powhatan.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two women came out with these last-mentioned settlers
to make real homes in Jamestown, the first English city
in what is now the United States. The same ship also
brought over presents from King James to the Indian
King Powhatan. These were a bed, basin and pitcher, a
coat trimmed with gold lace, and a crown.</p>

<p>Powhatan was therefore solemnly invited to Jamestown,
to receive these gifts and be crowned. The Indian chief
was greatly pleased with his fine red coat. But no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
could make him understand that he must kneel to receive
his crown. Finally, in despair, the colonists standing on
either side of him leaned so heavily upon his shoulders
that they forced him to bend the knee before the governor,
who quickly crowned him.</p>

<p>To the savages' great delight, drums were loudly beaten
in honor of King Powhatan, but when the cannon was
shot off, too, the newly crowned king of Virginia was so
amazed that he almost fell over backward. When he had
recovered from his fright Powhatan gave the governor his
old moccasins, or shoes, and a tattered and dirty robe of
raccoon skins, telling him to send them to King James in
return for his gifts!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXV. SMITH WOUNDED.</h2>


<p>The last Jamestown settlers brought over letters in
which the English merchants asked for gold, and
urged the colonists to make diligent search for a passage
to India, where so much money could be made by trading
for silks, pearls, and spices. In obedience to these orders,
a new excursion was tried, but of course no such passage
was ever found on the coast of Virginia.</p>

<p>When the ships went back to England, Smith sent a
letter to the company, begging them to send out farmers,
carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, and men to cut down
trees, rather than so many fine gentlemen who did not
know how to work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as soon as the ships had gone, Captain Smith set
all the colonists to work building houses, planting corn,
and working hard in many ways, so as to supply their
daily needs. He also ordered that the Indians should be
treated kindly. But the settlers, thinking they knew
better than he, refused to work, and treated the Indians
so unjustly that they secretly planned to kill all the
English.</p>

<p>We are told that this plot was overheard by Pocahontas.
She ran through the forest all alone, one dark night, and,
coming to Jamestown, secretly told Captain Smith of his
peril. He was so grateful to Pocahontas for her warning
that he wanted to give her a present; but she refused it,
saying that if her people saw it they would suspect she
had betrayed them.</p>

<p>By Captain Smith's wise measures, the Indians were
awed into good behavior, and for a time Jamestown was safe.
But, unfortunately, a terrible accident soon happened to
the brave man who had been the life of the colony. A
gun, shot off by accident, set fire to the powder in a boat
where Smith lay asleep. He was badly wounded, and
would have been burned to death had he not had the
presence of mind to roll out of the boat into the water.</p>

<p>There were no good doctors in Jamestown, and as the
wound in his thigh did not heal, Captain Smith sailed
back to England in the next vessel, never to visit Jamestown
again. But when quite cured he explored the northeast
coast of our country, and drew a good map of it,
calling that part of America New England. It was in
reward for this service that the king gave him the title of
"Admiral of New England." Being now too old to continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
his journeys any longer, Smith spent the rest of his
life in writing an account of his travels and of the founding
of Jamestown.</p>

<p>Some people say that Captain Smith, like many sailors,
was so fond of spinning yarns that he did not always tell
the exact truth. He cannot have been a bad man, however,
for when he died, those who had gone out to Jamestown
with him said that he hated baseness, laziness, pride,
and falsehood; that he never sent any one into a danger
he was not ready to share; that he was strictly honest in
all his dealings; and that he loved actions more than
words; and he was honored and mourned by all. Brave
Captain Smith was buried in London, where his friends
placed this inscription over his grave: "Here lies one
conquered, that hath conquered kings."</p>

<p>After Captain Smith left them, the Jamestown colonists
became idler than ever, and treated the Indians so unkindly
that even Pocahontas refused to visit them any more.
The result was that they could not buy any corn, and as
they had no crops of their own, they had so little food,
when winter came, that only sixty out of about six hundred
colonists managed to live.</p>

<p>This terrible winter in Jamestown is known in history
as "Starvation Time;" and some people say that the
settlers became so desperate from hunger that they actually
turned cannibals. Their sufferings were so great that
those who survived determined to go home in the spring.
So they put their scant stock of provisions on board their
ships, and prepared to sail.</p>

<p>But before leaving they wanted to set fire to the houses
they had built, and destroy the place where "none had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
enjoyed one happy day." The governor, however, refused
to let them do this. To make sure his orders should
not be disobeyed, he embarked last, after seeing that all
was safe.</p>

<p>The little band of discouraged settlers now sailed slowly
down the James River. But on reaching its mouth, they
were overjoyed to meet three ships coming from England,
with a stock of provisions and many new colonists. They
therefore turned around and went back to Jamestown,
where, you may be sure, they were very thankful to find
their houses still standing and all ready to receive them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXVI. THE VISIT OF POCAHONTAS TO
ENGLAND.</h2>


<p>A new governor, named Dale, now took charge of the
Jamestown colony, and seeing that the colonists were
lazy and indifferent, he tried to find out the cause. He
soon discovered that the workers thought it unjust that
they should have to feed the lazy, for the rule had been
that all supplies should go into a common storehouse, and
that each man should receive an equal share.</p>

<p>As the company had in 1609 received a new charter
from the king, granting them land for four hundred miles
along the coast, and thence "up into the land throughout
from sea to sea, west and northwest," they were very
anxious that the Jamestown colony should thrive. Dale,
therefore, now said that each man should work for himself
only. The result was that those who were willing to labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
were soon very comfortable, while the lazy colonists became
poorer and poorer. Still, seeing that they must
work or starve, the idlers now did enough to keep themselves
alive.</p>

<p>Other laws were made at the same time, and it was
decided that those who disobeyed them should have their
tongues pierced with a red-hot iron. From this time on
Jamestown prospered; more colonists came, grain became
plentiful, and instead of digging for gold, the settlers planted
tobacco to sell in England.</p>

<p>The English had by this time learned to like tobacco,
although King James disapproved so strongly of smoking
that he wrote a book called "A Counterblast to Tobacco."
In fact, the use of this weed was so general that the colonists,
finding they could get about seventy-five cents a
pound for it, raised all they could, thus following the
example set by John Rolfe, one of their number.</p>

<p>Four years after Captain Smith left the Jamestown
colony, the English captain Ar´gall, remembering how
useful Pocahontas had been, determined to capture her.
Hearing that she was with a neighboring tribe, he bargained
with the chief to lure her on board his vessel and
leave her there.</p>

<p>The chief consented, and walked off in triumph with his
reward,&mdash;a shiny copper kettle,&mdash;leaving Pocahontas in
the hands of Captain Argall. He took her to Jamestown,
where she was kindly treated. John Rolfe converted the
young prisoner, and made her his wife as soon as she had
been baptized. Powhatan and many of his tribe were
invited to this wedding, the first between an Englishman
and an Indian girl. Of course it was a great event in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
colony, so when the next ship went back to England it
carried this piece of news to court.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p099.jpg" width="450" height="354" alt="marriage" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Marriage of Pocahontas.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the king heard it he was greatly displeased, for
he fancied that, after marrying the daughter of the King
of Virginia, Rolfe might want to rule over the country.
But Rolfe wished nothing of the kind, and after growing
tobacco for a while, he took his Indian wife to England.</p>

<p>To please Captain Smith, the queen welcomed Pocahontas
kindly. She appeared at court in fashionable English
clothes,&mdash;which must have seemed very uncomfortable
to an Indian,&mdash;and was presented as the "Lady Rebecca,"
for since her baptism her name had been changed. Pocahontas
spent a few months in England, and she had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
started to return to Virginia, when she was taken ill and
died. But she left a little son, who lived to grow up and
became the ancestor of several noted families in Virginia.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p100.jpg" width="450" height="334" alt="wives" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Wives for the Virginians.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The colonists soon found tobacco so profitable that they
planted it even in the streets of Jamestown, and used it
for money. Instead of saying a thing was worth so many
dollars, as we do now, they said it was worth so many
pounds of tobacco. They rapidly grew rich, and as they
no longer feared starvation, all longed to have wives to
make them comfortable.</p>

<p>They therefore wrote to England, asking that women
should be sent out to them, offering to give from one hundred
to one hundred and fifty pounds of tobacco to pay
for their passage. The next ship, therefore, brought over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a cargo of young women, and the men who wanted wives
rushed down to the wharf, and wooed them so eagerly that
there were soon many happy homes in Virginia.</p>

<p>As tobacco crops rapidly exhaust the soil, the colonists
occupied more and more land, settling generally near a
stream, so that vessels could come and load at their private
docks. And because tobacco is planted, and not sown,
their lands were called plantations, a name still used in the
South for any large farm. Some people, however, say the
name was given to any settlement planted in a new place.</p>

<p>To make sure they would always have a good government,
the Virginia planters, who in 1619 had eleven
settlements, or boroughs, chose two men from each
borough to sit in a House of Bur´ges-ses at Jamestown.
These burgesses helped to make a set of laws, called the
"Great Charter." The fact that the colonists now had a
share in ruling themselves, made them take special pride in
their new homes, although they still spoke lovingly of
England as the "mother country."</p>

<p>Strange to relate, the same year that the Virginia colonists
claimed their right as freemen to help govern themselves,
a Dutch ship brought twenty negroes to Jamestown,
and sold them as slaves. But although these were the
first colored people in our country, they were not the first
or only slaves, for the king had already sent out a number
of convicts and homeless children to serve the colonists.</p>

<p>There was always a great difference between white and
colored slaves. White men were sold only for a certain
length of time, after which they again became free; but
the negroes were sold for good and all, and they and
their children were to be slaves forever.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXVII. HUDSON AND THE INDIANS.</h2>


<p>While the English were gaining ground in Virginia,
the other nations were not idle. The Spaniards,
as we have seen, had settled in Florida and New Mexico,
and, in the latter place especially, their priests started
several mission stations.</p>

<p>This was very dangerous work, because they often had
to go alone among the Indians, who at times rose up
against them and even tortured them to death. But these
priests were quite ready to die for the sake of their religion,
and although in the course of the next one hundred
years more than forty were murdered, others were always
ready to take their places.</p>

<p>After many failures the Spaniards finally made friends
with and converted most of the Pueb´lo Indians, who
learned to live on peaceable terms with the white men, as
they still do to-day. In fact, although they had but one
small town, Santa Fé, the Spaniards had many missions
and eleven churches in New Mexico before the Jamestown
colonists first sat in the House of Burgesses.</p>

<p>The French Huguenots, as already said, tried to make
a settlement in the southern part of our country, but had
been murdered by their Spanish neighbors. Next, some
Frenchmen tried to settle in Maine, but soon gave up the
attempt. Their first lasting settlement was therefore made
in 1604, at Port. Royal in A-ca´di-a, where they at first
suffered much, but afterwards prospered greatly and had
comfortable homes.</p>

<p>The Dutch, living near the ocean, were great seamen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and traders, so you will not be surprised to hear that they,
too, sent ships across the Atlantic before long. One of
these vessels, the <i>Half-Moon</i>, under Henry Hudson, came
over here to look for the northwest passage. Sailing
along the New England coast, and thence southward,
Hudson entered Del´a-ware and New York bays. He
also sailed up a great stream, then called the North River,
but now generally known as the Hudson (1609).</p>

<p>At first Hudson thought this broad river must be the
long-sought road to India, because at high tide the water
was salt many miles upstream. But sailing on, he finally
discovered that it was a river, which he explored to the
point where Al´ba-ny
now stands.
It was in September,
the weather was
beautiful, and Hudson
and his crew
were in raptures
over the lovely
views. The coming
of this vessel
created a great sensation
among the
Indians, who rushed to the edge of the
water to see the "great white bird."
They called the <i>Half-Moon</i> a bird on
account of its spreading sails.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p103.jpg" width="450" height="554" alt="hudson" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Hudson on the River.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Hudson traded with the natives for
tobacco and furs, and once when they tried to steal some
of his trinkets he gave them a terrible fright by shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
off his cannon. On his return he landed on Man-hat´tan
Island, where the Indians gave him a feast, breaking their
arrows to show he need fear no treachery on their part.</p>

<p>We are told that, in exchange for their hospitality,
Hudson offered the savages some rum to drink. They
looked at it, and smelled it, but passed it on without
tasting it. Finally the bottle came to an Indian who was
somewhat bolder than the rest, or who feared to offend
the white man. He drank a great deal of the liquor, but
he had no sooner done so than he fell down senseless, and
all his companions thought he was dead.</p>

<p>After a few hours, however, the Indian awoke from his
drunken sleep, to remark that the Dutchman had the
strongest water he had ever tasted. The other savages
were now all eager to try the "fire water" too; and, having
drunk it once, they took such a fancy to it that before
long they were ready to give all they had in exchange for
more. But, as you will see, this fire water was to do them
a great deal of harm.</p>

<p>On his way home Hudson stopped in England, where
they kept him a prisoner, saying an Englishman ought to
make discoveries only for the good of his own country.
But Hudson managed to send a description of his journey
to Holland, and he then reported that he had visited "as
beautiful a land as one can tread upon." Hearing from
him also that great bargains in furs could be made with
the Indians, Dutch merchants soon sent out vessels to
establish trading stations near Albany and on Manhattan
Island.</p>

<p>While the Dutch were thus bartering, Hudson, set free,
started out on a voyage for England. Sailing farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
north, in search of a passage to India, he came, in 1611,
to the bay which still bears his name. Here his crew
suffered so much from the cold climate that, in their anger
against their captain, they put him, his son, and seven sick
men in a boat, and cut them adrift. The ship came back
to Europe in safety, but nothing more was ever heard of
Hudson or the unfortunate sailors with him.</p>

<p>The Dutch soon built Fort Orange on the Hudson, near
Albany, Fort Nas´sau on the Delaware, and, later, a fort
on Manhattan Island. Here, in 1614, they founded the colony
later called New Am´ster-dam, on the very spot where a
shipwrecked captain had built the first Dutch-American vessel
about one year before. Little by little the Dutch now
took possession of the land along the Hudson River and
New York Bay. They built comfortable houses of bricks
brought over from Holland, and before long had many
thrifty farms in what they called the New Neth´er-lands.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXVIII. THE MAYFLOWER.</h2>


<p>While the Spaniards were settling in Florida and
New Mexico, the French in Acadia, and the Dutch
in the New Netherlands, the English, as we have seen,
had also been busy. In Virginia they had founded Jamestown,
and Gosnold and John Smith had visited and named
several places in New England, such as Cape Cod and the
Charles River.</p>

<p>During the next few years several attempts were made
to found a colony in New England, but all failed. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
although no real settlements were made, English fishing
vessels were often seen along the coast, where codfish
could easily be caught and dried. The captain of one of
these fishing boats is said to have captured twenty-four
Indians, whom he carried off to sell as slaves. Among
these savages was one named Squan´to. He was taken
first to Spain and then to England before he was shipped
back to his native land.</p>

<p>When poor Squanto finally reached the New England
shores once more he found everything sadly changed.
During his absence a terrible plague had broken out and
swept away nearly all his tribe. Wigwams, fields, hunting
and fishing grounds were now deserted, and the few Indians
who had escaped death had gone to live elsewhere.
Squanto therefore joined another tribe, to whom he soon
proved very useful, for he had learned enough English to
serve as interpreter between them and the fishermen.</p>

<p>Nowadays people can be of any religion they choose,
but in the beginning of the seventeenth century every one
was expected to practice the religion of the country in
which he lived. After following the Roman Catholic
religion for about nine centuries, the English, in the
middle of the sixteenth century, suddenly decided that
England should have a church of her own. Their king,
Henry VIII., said that while the pope was head of the
Roman Catholic Church, he would henceforth be head
of the An´gli-can or English Church. He added that all
his subjects would have to attend the services of that
church, and pay a tax to him for its support, just as they
had done to the pope.</p>

<p>Although there were a great many people quite willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to do this, others said that nothing would induce them to
give up the Roman Catholic religion. These people were
very firm, and although the king tried to force them to
change their religion, many of them bravely died rather
than do what they considered wrong.</p>

<p>At first there were only Roman Catholics and Anglicans
in England. But after a time some of the Anglicans said
that they wanted a plainer and <em>purer</em> religion. They repeated
this so often that before long they were known all
over England as the Pu´ri-tans. Next, some of the Puritans
refused to go to the Anglican Church at all, or to pay
for its support, and because they did this they were treated
just as unkindly as the Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>Those Puritans who separated themselves from their
brethren and refused to go to the Anglican Church were
soon called Sep´a-ra-tists. They were held in great contempt,
and persecuted by all those who did not believe
exactly as they did. After standing this for several years,
some of them left England in 1607, and after many trials
founded a Separatist colony at Leȳ´den in Holland.</p>

<p>Here they had to work very hard to make a living;
and although they tried to keep their children apart from
the rest of the people, they soon saw that the boys and
girls were learning the Dutch language and ways so
rapidly that before long they would cease to be English.
The Separatists therefore began to wonder where they
could go so their children would hear nothing but the
English language, have no dealings with people of a different
religion, and still have a fair chance to make a living.</p>

<p>They finally decided to go to the New World, and sent
to ask King James's permission to found a colony in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
place where, while remaining his faithful subjects, they
could worship as they pleased. James allowed them to
go to America, but refused to give them a paper granting
all the rights they wished. Still, as the Separatists knew
that the king was as likely to break a written promise as a
verbal one, they made up their minds to run the risk.</p>

<p>Too poor to hire vessels to carry them and their goods
across the ocean, the Separatists borrowed the necessary
money from English speculators, promising that all their
earnings for the next seven years should be equally divided
between the merchants and the colonists. Then, hearing
that none but Church of England people would be received
in Virginia, they decided to settle in the land Hudson had
described so favorably.</p>

<p>As the Separatists were about to set out on a long
pilgrimage, or journey, for the sake of their religion, they
took the name of Pilgrims. The youngest and strongest
among them were to go out first, under the guidance of
one of their teachers, Elder Brewster. But all the old
and feeble members were to remain in Holland a little
longer, in charge of their minister, Mr. Rob´in-son. After
a last feast together, and a solemn parting prayer, the
Pilgrims received their pastor's blessing, said good-by to
their friends, and embarked on the <i>Speedwell</i> at Delfs-ha´ven.
The spot whence they started is now marked by
a monument commemorating their departure, and from
there Robinson prayerfully watched them until they were
out of sight. Although their vessel was old and leaky, the
Pilgrims reached South-amp´ton safely. Here they found
friends waiting for them, and all ready to sail in the <i>Mayflower</i>.
After a short delay both vessels set out together;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
but they soon had to put back, because the <i>Speedwell</i>
proved unsafe. Leaving it at Plymouth, one hundred and
two of the most
determined Pilgrims
embarked
on the <i>Mayflower</i>,
which set out
alone to cross the
Atlantic Ocean
(1620).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p109.jpg" width="250" height="207" alt="mayflower" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Mayflower.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In those times
all travel, whether
by land or sea,
was very slow.
It was therefore
only after sixty-three
days that the <i>Mayflower</i>, driven out of its course
by a storm, reached Cape Cod Bay. Thus, you see, it
came to the shores of New England instead of New
York or New Jersey. During that long and tempestuous
journey one of the passengers died; but as one little baby
was born on the ship, the Pilgrims still numbered one hundred
and two souls.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXIX. PLYMOUTH ROCK.</h2>


<p>The season was so far advanced when the Pilgrims
reached our northeast coast, and the seas were so
rough, that the captain of the <i>Mayflower</i> said it would not
be safe to go any farther. So the Pilgrims, who were tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of the ship and eager to begin building their new homes,
decided to settle in New England. Before they left the
ship, however, the men assembled in the little cabin to
draw up a paper, in which they pledged themselves to be
true to their country, king, and religion, and to obey any
laws made for the good of the colony. Then they elected
John Carver, one of their number, as governor for one year,
and named Miles Stand´ish, an old soldier, their captain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The First Wash Day.</p></div>
</div>

<p>While the women hastened ashore to wash their linen,
Standish and his little band of Pilgrim soldiers began to
explore the coast to find the best spot for their settlement.
For a few days they tramped up and down on Cape
Cod, once only catching a glimpse of an Indian and a dog.
But finally they came to a ruined wigwam, where they
saw a copper kettle. This showed them that Europeans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
had been there before. Soon after they found some
buried corn, and carried it off, intending to pay the
owners for it later.</p>

<p>About three weeks after this, some Pilgrims and seamen
took a boat and sailed off to make a more extensive exploration
of the coast. After going a long distance they landed,
and as they walked along they were surprised to find so
many graves, for they did not know then that the plague
had raged there two years before. Early one day, after
spending an uncomfortable night out of doors, and saying
their morning prayers, the explorers were startled by a
terrible Indian war whoop, and a flight of arrows fell all
around them.</p>

<p>But Miles Standish was so brave a man that he made
his men stand firm and drive the Indians away. The Indians
had attacked the party only because they fancied
that the Pilgrims had come to steal Indians, as the fishermen
had done several times before.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims now continued their explorations in the
midst of a driving snowstorm. Their rudder broke, and
they had to steer with their oars. Finally they were
driven ashore, where they kindled a fire, spending Sunday
in prayer and praise, and resuming their journey only on
Monday morning.</p>

<p>On December 21 or 22 they again ran ashore, landing on
a rock, since called "the stepping-stone of New England,"
and now carefully preserved and known as "Plymouth
Rock." The land around seemed so favorable that they
decided to plant their colony here, naming it Plymouth,
in honor of the last English town they had seen before
leaving old England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>As the landing of the Pilgrim fathers is one of the great
events of our history, the anniversary of their coming is
still kept in New England and elsewhere, and is known as
"Forefathers' Day."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p112.jpg" width="450" height="347" alt="landing" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Landing on Plymouth Rock.</p></div>
</div>

<p>While Standish and his men were busy exploring, the
<i>Mayflower</i> rode at anchor, and its inmates barely escaped
a horrible death. One of the colonists, named Bil´ling-ton,
having, gone into the cabin to get powder, carelessly left
the barrel open. His boy, a mischievous youngster, crept
into the cabin unseen, and began playing with a gun. Of
course it went off unexpectedly, and the child came very
near setting fire to the powder in the barrel, and thus
blowing up the <i>Mayflower</i> and all on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Standish had made his report, the anchor
was raised, and four days later the Pilgrims landed on
Plymouth Rock. The first woman to set foot upon it,
we are told, was a Puritan maiden. Soon all the settlers
were very busy building a storehouse for their provisions,
and homes for themselves.</p>

<p>The men, exposed to the bad weather, caught such
heavy colds that before long all were ill, and when the
storehouse and a log hut were finished, both had to serve
as hospitals for the sick. In spite of an unusually mild
winter, the colonists found their close quarters on the
<i>Mayflower</i> and in damp log houses so uncomfortable that
they suffered greatly.</p>

<p>At one time all but seven were seriously ill, and in the
course of the winter nearly half of their number perished.
Grave after grave was dug in the frozen ground, but the
Pilgrims dared not mark them in any way, lest the Indians
should discover how many of the white men had died.
They were careful about this, because, although they had
not seen any, they knew that Indians were lurking near
them, for tools left in the woods a few hours had mysteriously
vanished.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXX. THE FIRST AMERICAN THANKSGIVING.</h2>


<p>Early in the spring the Pilgrims were startled, one
day, by the voice of an Indian saying: "Welcome,
Englishmen." Looking up, they saw a savage named Sam´o-set,
who had boldly walked into their village to greet
them with words learned from English fishermen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pilgrims received Samoset so kindly that he came
back on the morrow with Squanto, who told the colonists
that the Indian chief Mas´sa-soit wished to make friends
with them. A meeting was appointed, and when Massasoit
appeared, a few days later, Standish received him.
The drums were beaten loudly, and the Pilgrim soldiers
gravely escorted the Indian chief to their principal log
hut, where Governor Carver was waiting for them.</p>

<p>Here all the choice articles of the Pilgrims had been
gathered together to make a fine show, and a rug and
green cushion were laid on the floor for Massasoit to sit
upon.</p>

<p>After smoking the calumet, or "pipe of peace," together,
the Indian chief and the Plymouth governor&mdash;with
the help of their interpreters&mdash;made a treaty,
whereby they promised not to harm but to help each
other, and to trade in a friendly spirit.</p>

<p>The Indians now walked freely in and out of the village,
where they ate and drank so much that the Pilgrims' scant
stock of provisions grew rapidly less. Edward Wins´low,
one of the Pilgrims, therefore took occasion, on returning
Massasoit's visit, to tell him that the Indians were to come
to Plymouth only when they bore messages from him. To
make sure that the right Indians would always be well
treated, Winslow gave Massasoit a ring, which was to
serve as passport for his men.</p>

<p>Were you to read Winslow's description of his visit to
the Indian chief, you would be greatly amused. Massasoit
had no provisions in his wigwam, so he and his guests
went to bed hungry. Besides, Winslow and his men had
to sleep side by side with the dirty chief and his squaw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and they were so crowded by other Indians that they
were very uncomfortable indeed.</p>

<p>In April the <i>Mayflower</i> went back to England; but
although the Pilgrims had suffered so sorely during the
winter, they all wrote brave letters to send home, and not
one of them asked to go back. After the <i>Mayflower</i> had
sailed away Governor Carver fell ill and died, so William
Bradford was elected to take his place. This Bradford
made so good a ruler that he was elected again and again,
and during the next thirty-six years he was head of the
colony nearly all the time.</p>

<p>Squanto soon became a great favorite with the Pilgrims.
He played with the children, taught the boys to trap
game, and told the settlers to plant their corn as soon as
the leaves of the white oak were as large as a mouse's
ear. He also taught them to put a fat fish in each hill,
to serve as manure for the growing grain, because the
ground around there was very sandy.</p>

<p>The colonists now worked diligently, making their fields
and gardens over the graves of their dead companions, so
that no hostile Indians should ever find out how many
had died, or dig up their bones. The crops being all
planted, the Pilgrims went on building, made friends with
nine Indian chiefs, and traded briskly with the savages for
furs.</p>

<p>But day by day the stock of provisions brought from
England grew less and less, until they finally saw with
dismay that it would be entirely exhausted long before
their corn was ripe. So they were put on such scant rations
that it is said they sometimes had only six grains of
corn for a meal! As they were not good hunters or experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
fishermen, they lived almost entirely on shellfish,
Elder Brewster piously giving thanks to God for supplying
them with "the abundance of the seas and the treasures
hid in the sand."</p>

<p>Although the winter had been very damp, the summer
proved so dry that it soon seemed as if the Pilgrims' crops
would perish for want of rain. A day of fasting and prayer
was therefore appointed, and for nine hours the Pilgrims
besought God to help them. Some Indians, hearing that
they were going to pray for rain, watched the sky anxiously,
and when it finally clouded over and a gentle rain
began to fall, they remarked in awe-struck tones that the
God of the white men had evidently heard their prayers.</p>

<p>Ten days of moisture which followed the day of prayer
assured a plentiful harvest, which was safely gathered.
The Pilgrims were so grateful for this mercy that they set
a day in which to give thanks. After a solemn service
they held a great feast, to which Massasoit and ninety
other Indians were invited.</p>

<p>At this dinner they ate wild turkeys shot by the colonists,
venison supplied by the savages, and pies which the
Pilgrim mothers made from yellow pumpkins, as they had
no apples. During the next three days all the young
people indulged in games and athletic sports, in which the
Indians also shared. After this "Thanksgiving Day," as
the Pilgrims named it, a feast like it was kept every year
in New England. This custom gradually spread from
there over the whole country, until now the day is observed
in all the states of our Union. The President, who
appoints the day, generally chooses the last Thursday in
November.</p>

<h2>XXXI. THE SNAKE SKIN AND THE
BULLETS.</h2>


<p>As the Pilgrims were just in all their dealings with
the Indians, and honestly paid them for the corn
taken when they first landed, the natives became quite
friendly. They not only brought back the missing tools,
but once found and carried home the mischievous Billington
boy, who had lost his way in the forest, near the pond
which still bears his name.</p>

<p>The Indians felt such respect for the Pilgrims that when
Massasoit fell ill he sent for Winslow right away. The
latter went to the chief's wigwam, where he found a crowd
of Indians eagerly watching the antics of the medicine
man, who had come to drive away the chief's disease.</p>

<p>After ordering all the Indians out of the wigwam,
Winslow let in some fresh air, cooled the sick Indian's
hot brow and hands with clean water, and gave him some
medicine. Presently the savage chief asked for chicken
broth, which he had once tasted at Plymouth, so Winslow
sent a messenger to Plymouth for a fowl. Thanks to
Winslow's good nursing,&mdash;for fresh air and cleanliness are
good doctors,&mdash;Massasoit soon recovered, and ever after
he was the white men's firm ally.</p>

<p>All the Indians were not friendly, however. Ca-non´i-cus,
chief of the Nar-ra-gan´setts, an enemy of Massasoit,
hated to see the land occupied by the English, so he soon
sent them a rattlesnake's skin full of arrows. Governor
Bradford looked at it wonderingly and then asked Squanto
what it meant. The Indian said it signified that unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the white men crept away like serpents the Indians would
slay them all with their arrows.</p>

<p>Hearing this, Bradford coolly took the arrows out of the
skin, stuffed it full of powder and bullets, and silently
handed it to the messenger to carry back to Canonicus.
The savage glided rapidly away, and gave the skin to
Canonicus, who, afraid of the powder, passed it on to
another Indian. The snake skin went thus from hand to
hand, but was finally sent back to Plymouth, with an offer
of friendship. The Indians, seeing that the English governor
was not afraid of them, now begged for peace,
promising to bury the war hatchet so deep that it could
never again be dug up.</p>

<p>The fact is that powder at first seemed a very mysterious
thing to the red men. They were afraid of it, but
at the same time longed to have some. One Indian is
said to have bought powder from a colonist, who gravely
told him that if he wanted any more he must plant the
black seed. The savage obeyed, but as nothing came up
from it, the shrewd Indian declared that he would pay the
colonist only when the powder grew!</p>

<p>The Pilgrims, fearing the Indians might attack them,
built a log meetinghouse on a hill, and used it as a fort,
placing their cannon on its flat roof. This place was also
surrounded by a palisade, or great fence of tree trunks, so
that it could afford the colonists a safe shelter in time
of danger. Generally, however, it served as a meetinghouse,
for the Pilgrims were all very religious, and when
the drums beat on Sunday morning all came out of their
houses and marched in solemn procession to church.</p>

<p>At the door the men stacked their arms, leaving them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in charge of a guard, who was to give the alarm at the
first sign of danger. In the meetinghouse men and
women sat apart, listening to the long prayers and sermons,
or slowly singing very sober hymns. The boys sat
on the pulpit steps, in full view of the congregation, to
make sure they would behave properly.</p>

<p>The sexton, armed with a long stick, rapped the boys
on the head if they proved unruly, or poked the men
when they fell asleep. But if the girls or women dozed,
he gently tickled their cheeks with the foxtail hanging at
the other end of the same stick. Sometimes, too, it was
he who turned the hourglass when all its sands had run
out, for the minister was then only halfway through his
two hours' sermon.</p>

<p>In the first fall the colony was increased by the arrival
of more Separatists; but it did not really prosper until the
settlers bought the shares of the English merchants, and,
instead of holding everything in common, began to work
each for himself. They were so industrious and thrifty
that before long their debts were all paid, and they had
comfortable homes and good farms.</p>

<p>The Plymouth people were so strict that they would
allow none but church members to vote. Their colony
therefore grew very slowly, and at the end of ten years
it numbered only about three hundred souls. But other
Puritans, who did not believe exactly as the Plymouth colonists,
came over to America and founded other colonies
along the New England coast.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 408px;">

<div class="caption"><p><small><i>G. H. Boughton, Artist.</i></small></p>

<p class="center">Pilgrims going to Church.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus, for instance, the first Mas-sa-chu´setts Bay colonists
came over in 1628. As their hope was to convert the
Indians, they adopted a seal on which there was an Indian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a><br /><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with the inscription, "Come over and help us." They,
too, were very strict. They said, "No idle drone may live
among us," and expected every one to work hard. They
settled at some distance from Plymouth (map, page 230),
in a spot which they called Sa´lem ("Peace"), because
they hoped to live and worship there in peace.</p>

<p>The principal man in the Massachusetts Bay colony was
John En´di-cott. He felt such intense horror for the Roman
Catholic religion that before he had been in America
very long, he drew out his sword and cut the cross right
out of the English flag, saying that Puritans could not
look with respect upon such a popish emblem. Besides,
hearing that some English colonists had put up a Maypole
on Merry Mount, and danced there, he cut down the pole
and scolded the people for indulging in "the folly of
amusements."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXII. THE BEGINNING OF BOSTON.</h2>


<p>Besides Puritans, a few other men came over to New
England. Among these was Standish, who, as you
know, proved very useful to the Plymouth colony, and a
learned man named Black´stone. The latter tried at first
to live with the Separatists at Plymouth, but when he
saw that they were not willing to let him do as he thought
right, and wanted to force him to think just as they did,
he boldly said: "I came from England because I did not
like the Lord Bishops, but I cannot join with you, because
I would not be under the Lord Brethren."</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, Blackstone left the colony, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
withdrew to a hill about forty miles up the coast, where
he built himself a comfortable house. Here he soon had
a fine garden, where he grew the first apples seen in New
England; and his cow, wandering around in search of
pasture, made the first winding paths through the forest
in that part of the country.</p>

<p>Although the Plymouth settlers were, as we have seen,
usually on friendly terms with the Indians, there were
some worthless settlers where Weymouth (wā´mŭth) now
is, who soon quarreled with them (1623). Hearing that
the Indians had planned to kill all the whites, Captain
Standish and his little force marched over to Weymouth.
Though small, he was very brave. He sent for the Indian
chiefs, and met them in a log hut. When one of them
threatened his life, Standish boldly attacked him. There
was a terrible tussle, but the white man finally killed his
huge enemy. This act of daring made other Indians
respect Standish, whom they called the "big little man."</p>

<p>While Standish was struggling with one Indian, two
more were killed by the other white men in the hut, and
a few others were slain afterwards. When this news reached
Mr. Robinson at Leyden, he sadly cried: "Oh, that they
had converted some before they killed any!"</p>

<p>In 1630 the colonists of Massachusetts Bay were reinforced
by the arrival of seven hundred newcomers, "the
very flower of the English Puritans." Led by John
Winthrop, a noble and clever man, some of them came
over in a ship which was called the <i>Lady Arbela</i>, in
honor of a delicate lady on board. But seventy-six days
of sea journey proved so trying to this frail woman that
she died soon after landing at Salem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the newcomers tried to settle near Charles´town;
but they found the drinking water so bad there that they
finally went to Trimountain, or Tre´mont ("Three Hills"),
where Blackstone had built his house. Not liking to live
so near a large colony of Puritans, Blackstone sold them
his house and land, and went to settle elsewhere.</p>

<p>The land thus purchased was divided among the settlers,
who, for convenience' sake, built their houses along the
paths made by Blackstone's cow. Some people say that
this accounts for the crooked streets in old Boston, for such
was the name this settlement received soon after it was
made (1630). Six acres, however, were set apart as the
Common, or pasture ground, for everybody. This part of
Blackstone's farm still bears that name, but it is now in
the very heart of the city of Boston, a beautiful, well-kept
park, and no longer a mere pasture ground.</p>

<p>The Boston colonists had brought tools, cattle, and seed
in abundance; but in spite of all their foresight and supplies,
their first winter proved very hard. It was very cold,
and as they had to go some distance for their fuel, many
could not secure enough. We are told that one man was
even caught stealing wood from Winthrop's pile. Now,
the Puritans considered stealing almost as bad as murder,
and had the man been publicly accused, they would perhaps
have condemned him to death. But Governor
Winthrop was so good and gentle that he merely said
he would cure the man of the habit of stealing, and did so
by sending the rascal all the fuel he needed until spring.</p>

<p>Like the Plymouth colonists, the Puritans were threatened
with starvation long before their ships could return.
Winthrop then generously supplied the people's needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
from his own store, and actually gave the last flour he had
in his house to a poor man who came to beg. But the
good governor did not suffer on account of his generosity,
for that very day the returning ships sailed into port,
bringing plenty of provisions for all.</p>

<p>The colony now prospered greatly, and sent home such
encouraging letters that more and more people ventured
across the ocean. Winthrop sent for his wife, and a minister
wrote to his friends that "a sup of New England
air is better than a whole draught of Old England's Ale."</p>

<p>During the next ten years, more than twenty thousand
English-speaking persons came over to New England.
There, in time, they formed fifty parishes, or villages,
connected by roads and bridges. Some of these settlements
were planted far inland, although the Puritans at
first declared they would never need more land than what
was inclosed in a circle drawn ten miles around Boston.</p>

<p>A governor was elected to rule over the colony, and
each town ruled itself. But the people also sent representatives
to the General Court, or Assembly, where
public matters were discussed and laws were made for the
good of the whole colony.</p>

<p>The government being in the hands of the people,
and the Puritans wishing their children to be well educated,
public schools were soon provided in every village, and in
1636 the General Court started the first college. It was
located in a spot which was called Cam´bridge, in honor
of the great university town in England. Two years later,
a minister named Har´vard left his library of about two
hundred and fifty books and some money to the new college,
which since then has borne his name.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXXIII. STORIES OF TWO MINISTERS.</h2>


<p>At first, Harvard College had only a very few students,
who were to be educated for the ministry. All the
colonists contributed to the support of the institution, for
those who were too poor to give twelvepence in money
were told to bring a measure of corn or some fire wood.
Four years after the college was founded, the first English
printing press was set up there, and began to print books
of psalms for the Puritan churches.</p>

<p>While the new college was training missionaries for the
Indians, the latter had found a good friend in John El´i-ot,
who came over to America in 1631. While preaching in
Boston and Rox´bur-y, Eliot learned the Massachusetts
Indian language, and began to translate the Bible into that
tongue. It took him nearly thirty years of patient work
to do this, in the midst of all his preaching and teaching.
But his Bible was the first printed in America, and many
of his "praying Indians," as the converts were called,
learned to read in it.</p>

<p>Eliot was a sweet, simple, and very lovable man. He
was so generous that once, in paying him his salary, the
parish treasurer tied it up in the good man's handkerchief
with several knots, so that he should not be able to give it
all away before reaching home. But Eliot, unable to undo
these hard knots when he met a poor woman, gave her
handkerchief and all, saying: "Here, my dear, take it; I
believe the Lord designs it all for you."</p>

<p>After years of faithful work among the savages, Eliot,
the "Apostle of the Indians," died, at the age of eighty-six.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
He tried harder than any other Puritan to convert
the red men, who lost their best friend when he passed
away. The Bible he worked so diligently to translate still
exists; but as there are no Massachusetts Indians left, it is
now of no use, except to remind us of Eliot's great patience
and perseverance.</p>

<p>As the soil was poor, hands few, and the harvests too
scanty to supply food for all, the colonists soon began to
wonder how they could earn money. Before long, they
discovered that by sending fish to England, they could
get all the food they wanted. For that reason they fished
diligently, and soon used a huge codfish as an emblem for
the Massachusetts Bay colony. Next, the colonists built a
large ship called the <i>Blessing of the Bay</i>, in which they
sent lumber to the West Indies. In exchange for timber,
they got sugar and molasses, from which they made rum
to ship to England. Thus commerce was begun, and,
increasing year by year, finally made the Massachusetts
Puritans both rich and independent.</p>

<p>The Puritans, as you have seen, left England because
they were not allowed to worship there as they pleased.
But although they did not like it when the English
tried to make them obey the Anglican Church, they now
wanted to force all who came among them to think just
as they did.</p>

<p>One young man, Roger Williams, came to New England
in 1631, and preached for a while at Salem. But
as he openly said that the Puritans had no right to punish
people for thinking differently about religious matters, or
for such trifles as smoking on the street or laughing too
loud, he soon displeased some of the colonists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>They sent him away for a while, thinking he would
change his mind; but when Williams came back to Salem,
he insisted harder than ever that every man had a right to
think just as he pleased, to worship God as his conscience
bade him, and to vote whether he went to church or not.
He also declared that the land around there belonged to
the Indians and not to the King of England. These opinions
seemed so wicked to the good Puritans that they called
him up before their Council to reprove him.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p128.jpg" width="450" height="370" alt="williams" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Williams Welcomed by the Indians.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Finding that the Puritans would not let him live in peace
in any part of the colony, but intended to send him back
to England to be tried, Williams secretly escaped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Massachusetts, and went to live among the Indians. As he
knew their language, and had made friends with them, he
spent a very peaceful winter in their camp.</p>

<p>When spring came, Williams wanted to settle at
See´konk; but as the Plymouth people claimed that part of
the land, he went farther still, to a place which he called
Prov´i-dence. Settling there, in 1636, on land he bought
from the Indians, Williams was soon joined by others who
shared his opinions, and thus a colony was formed in what
is now Rhode Island, where all except Jews were allowed
to vote. This was considered very generous in those days,
although it now seems unfair to exclude anyone on account
of religion.</p>

<p>Because Williams was so much broader-minded than
many other people of his time, he has often been called
the "Apostle of Toleration"&mdash;a word which means letting
others alone, or allowing others to do as they please.
People of every belief came to settle in Williams's neighborhood
before long, and there was soon such a variety
of them that it was said if a man had lost his religion he
would be sure to find it again in Rhode Island.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXIV. WILLIAMS AND THE INDIANS.</h2>


<p>One of the first important persons who followed
Williams to Rhode Island was Mrs. Anne Hutch´in-son.
Soon after her arrival in Massachusetts, in 1634, she
began to hold meetings and to preach. The Puritans, who
did not believe in women's talking in public, told her to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
silent; but she refused to obey, and went on preaching
until she gained great influence over many people.</p>

<p>Indeed, when an Indian war broke out, her followers
even refused to go and fight unless she was allowed to
talk just as much as she pleased. But as soon as the war
was over, Mrs. Hutchinson was banished. Then she, too,
went to Rhode Island (1637), where she bought from the
Indians the large island of that name. She gave them
only twenty hoes, ten coats, and forty fathoms of wampum
in payment for it, and near one end of it she began
the town which is now the beautiful city of New´port.
Several Quakers, driven out of the Massachusetts colonies
by the Puritans, also came to live near her, and her settlement
prospered greatly.</p>

<p>Other colonies were also begun farther north. A short
time after the founding of Plymouth, Mason and Gor´ges
received from the king a grant of land. Coming over to
America, they divided their land and founded colonies,
Gorges in Maine and Mason in New Hamp´shire. Among
the principal settlements thus made were the towns of
Ports´moŭth and Dover. Some years later, however, these
places were added to Massachusetts, to which colony
New Hampshire was joined for about thirty-five years.</p>

<p>In 1630, at the time when Boston was founded,
some fishermen reported that the Con-nect´i-cut River
flowed between very fertile banks. This news made Lords
Say, Brooke, and others ask for a grant of land there,
which the king readily gave them. These owners then
prepared to found a new colony, which was called Say´brook,
after two of their number. But they very soon found
that there was no time to lose if they wanted to claim the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
land the king had given them, for the Dutch had already
built a trading station where Hartford now stands, and
were threatening to occupy all the Connecticut valley.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the Dutch got there first, Winthrop's
son was told to build a fort at the mouth of the
Connecticut, or Long River, where he was soon joined by
a colony of about fifty men. These settlers suffered
greatly from lack of food and proper shelter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Carrying Mrs. Hooker to Hartford.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Still, the white men spread rapidly in Connecticut, and
in the spring of 1636, Pastor Hooker, "the light of the
western church," came there from Massachusetts, with
about one hundred men, women, and children. Walking
through the woods, driving their cattle before them, and
carrying poor sick Mrs. Hooker on a litter, these colonists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
came to settle on the banks of the Connecticut, where
they founded Hartford. They brought written laws with
them, in which, among other things, it was stated that a
man need not be a church member to vote.</p>

<p>But the Connecticut colonists soon met two foes in
this new region; they were the Dutch and the Pe´quot
Indians, of whom the latter proved by far the more troublesome.
Soon after murdering one settler, the Pequots
carried his family off to Block Island. The news of murder
and capture no sooner reached Massachusetts, than
ninety men set out, under John Endicott, to punish the
Indians.</p>

<p>Sailing to Block Island, the Indian stronghold, they
killed the Indians and burned down their village. Then
some of them went on to the Connecticut valley, to join
and help the English there. The Pequots, angry with
the colonists, now sought the friendship of the Narragansett
and Mo-he´gan Indians; for they thought that if three
such powerful tribes joined forces, the white men would
soon be crushed.</p>

<p>When the settlers heard of this, they were terrified.
But knowing Roger Williams was the only man who could
prevent the Narragansetts from making an alliance with
their foes, they hastily sent him a message, imploring his
aid. Instead of acting meanly, as some other men would
have done in his place, and leaving those who had treated
him ill to look out for themselves, Roger Williams set out
right away, although a terrible storm was then raging.</p>

<p>Narrowly escaping death, he paddled bravely on in his
frail skiff till he came to the Narragansetts' camp. There
he found the Pequots fiercely urging their friends to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
by showing them the bloody scalps they had already taken.
During the next three days and nights, Williams pleaded
and argued with the Narragansett Indians, and he finally
persuaded them not to take part in the Pequot war.
Thanks to his efforts, too, the Mohegans sided with the
white men, their chief bravely helping John Mason, the
commander of the settlers' force.</p>

<p>After a night spent in prayer, the combined force of
colonists and friendly Indians suddenly attacked the principal
Pequot camp in what is now southeastern Connecticut.
Taken unawares, the savages, roused by the barking
of their dogs, sprang out of their wigwams, only in time
to see the white men rush into their fort. A moment
later, the invaders flung blazing torches at their dwellings,
which were soon in flames over the heads of their wives
and children. Many perished in the fire, and the glare of
the flames allowed the colonists to see and kill nearly all
their dusky foes.</p>

<p>Soon after this massacre, the Pequot chief was overtaken
and slain, and his head was long exposed on a tree,
in a place since known as Sachems Head, or Point. The
few remaining Pequots either became slaves or fled to the
Hudson River. This was the first real Indian war in New
England (1636-1638). After it was all over the colonists
along the Connecticut were left in peace, and for nearly
forty years there was no more trouble with the red men.</p>

<p>The Pequot war was scarcely finished when three hundred
English settlers came to found New Haven. They
were mostly rich trading people, and they wanted to have
a colony which would be governed only by the laws of
the Bible. The New Haven colony grew fast, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
long included Saybrook and five other very prosperous
towns.</p>

<p>It was in the Pequot war that the colonies first saw the
advantage of helping one another, and five years later
(1643) a league was formed between Massachusetts Bay,
Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. Maine and
Rhode Island were not allowed to join it, because they
were not Puritan colonies. But New Hampshire really
belonged to it, as that colony had been joined to Massachusetts
in 1641.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXV. THE QUAKERS.</h2>


<p>While the English were founding the New England
colonies, many changes had taken place in
England. King James I. was succeeded by Charles I.,
and the English, weary of monarchs who did not keep
their promises, rose up in rebellion in 1643.</p>

<p>By this time, the English Puritans had increased so
that they became masters of the whole country. It was
governed by their chief, Oliver Crom´well, and called the
Commonwealth of England. The Puritans, being in power,
made the Roman Catholics and the Church of England
people as uncomfortable as the latter had once made them.
Many Catholics and Anglicans were therefore only too
glad to cross the ocean, in their turn, so as to found new
homes where they could worship as they pleased; and you
shall soon hear how they prospered.</p>

<p>Cromwell, as Protector of the Commonwealth of England,
made a new law (1651), called the Navigation Act.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
By this law it was decided that the colonists should build
no more ships, and that all their goods should be carried
across the ocean only in English vessels. This law was
very unjust, and captains of English ships speedily took
advantage of it to raise their prices for freight. So, while
England was rapidly growing rich, her colonists grumbled
sorely at the heavy rates they had to pay.</p>

<p>That same year began the great Quaker excitement in
Massachusetts. The Quakers were the disciples of a
very good man, George Fox. They called themselves
Friends, but were called Quakers by the other people,
because they often said one ought to quake at the thought
of the wrath of God.</p>

<p>As some of the months and days of the week bore the
names of old heathen gods, the Friends would not use
them, but, instead, numbered the days and months, speaking
of the first day of the sixth month, the twelfth day of
the second month, and so on. They would not take any
oaths, either, but used only the words "yea" and "nay."
They further treated all persons alike, calling even the king
by his given name, and refused to take off their hats in his
presence. Although generally quiet and modest, a few
of the Quakers were so anxious to spread the teachings
of their preacher Fox that they came over to Massachusetts,
knowing they would be illtreated there.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they began preaching, and firmly but
quietly refused to stop when told to do so. They were
therefore tortured and punished in many ways. A few
were whipped, sent to jail, or put in the stocks. Their
books were burned; they were driven out of the colony;
and as all this was not enough, four of them were hanged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The Quaker excitement finally grew so great that
some of them were sent back to England and the rest
forced to take refuge in Rhode Island, where they could
practice any religion they liked. But the Quakers who
had been shipped back to England, and especially a few
discontented colonists, complained very much of the Massachusetts
government, and made considerable trouble for
New England.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXVI. THE KING-KILLERS.</h2>


<p>Cromwell having died in 1658, the English, most
of whom were still greatly attached to the royal
family, soon begged Charles II. to come back and take
possession of his throne. He gladly returned to England,
where he punished no one for the revolution, except the
men who had condemned his father, Charles I., to death.
A few of these king-killers, or "reg´i-cides," as they were
called, fled from England as soon as they heard the king
was coming, and three took passage for America.</p>

<p>Two of these men, Goffe and Whal´ley, after some
trouble, reached the New Haven colony, where Puritan
friends helped them to hide. The king sent orders
to arrest them, and magistrates began to search every
house to secure the regicides. For about eighteen years
these two men lived in constant dread of being caught;
but, thanks to their many friends, they always escaped.
They dwelt for a while in a deserted mill, then in a cave,
and once hid under a bridge while their pursuers galloped
over it, expecting soon to overtake them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that the New Haven people had sheltered some
of his father's judges, added to the complaints of the
Quakers and discontented colonists, displeased Charles II.
greatly; and he finally declared that New Haven should
cease to form a separate colony, and joined it to Connecticut,
which received a new charter (1662).</p>

<p>It is also said, however, that these two colonies were
united mainly to please the Connecticut people, because
they had won the king's favor by sending him a pretty
message to welcome him back to the throne. The charter
he gave them was the most liberal ever granted the colonists,
although the one Roger Williams secured for Rhode
Island also granted many privileges.</p>

<p>You doubtless remember the treaty made between the
Indian King Massasoit and Governor Carver, when the
Pilgrims first came to Plymouth. This treaty was kept
forty years, and Massasoit and his tribe faithfully helped
the colonists to fight the other Indians. But when Massasoit
died, his two sons, who had received the names of
Alexander and Philip, began to rule in their turn.</p>

<p>Alexander knew, by the wampum belts which were the
history books of his tribe, that nearly all the land of his
Indian fathers had been sold to the white men, piece by
piece. It had been given in exchange for beads, kettles,
blankets, etc., and now very little was left. But the
Indians fancied that, although they had sold the land, they
could still hunt and fish there as much as they pleased.
The colonists, however, would not allow them to do so,
and drove the Indians farther and farther off, until they
began to feel cramped for space.</p>

<p>It is said that when one of the colonists once came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
bid an Indian chief to remove still farther from the white
settlements, the red man invited him to take a seat beside
him on a log. Crowding nearer and nearer his guest,
the chief bade him move again and again, until he forced
him to the very end of the log. But when the colonist
declared he could not move another inch without falling
off, the chief calmly answered: "It is just so with us.
We have moved as far as we can go, and now you come
here to ask us to move farther still."</p>

<p>This feeling of unfair treatment made Alexander so
angry, at last, that he formed a secret alliance with the
Narragansett Indians to kill all the white men. But the
Plymouth governor, hearing of this, promptly sent for him,
bidding him come and clear himself of the accusation of
treachery. Then, as the Indian did not obey at once, Winslow
quickly set out, with his men, to bring him by force.</p>

<p>Alexander, furious at being thus compelled to mind, fell
seriously ill from fever. The colonists then allowed his
followers to carry him home; but on the way back, the
Indian chief breathed his last. Ever after, his people were
in the habit of saying that he had gone to the Happy Hunting
Grounds, where the palefaces could never come to
crowd him out.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXVII. KING PHILIP'S WAR.</h2>


<p>At Alexander's death, Philip became chief of his tribe;
and thinking the English had poisoned Alexander, he
began to plot revenge. After brooding over his wrongs
for several years, Philip was accused of planning to attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the colonists. The governor of Plymouth sent word to
Philip to come and explain his conduct, but, we are told,
the Indian haughtily said to the messenger: "Your governor
is but a subject of King Charles of England. I shall
not treat with a subject. I shall only treat with the king,
my brother. When he comes, I am ready."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p139.jpg" width="450" height="292" alt="attack" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">An Indian Attack.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Still, Philip did come, and promised to keep the peace.
But a few years later, he was about to fall upon the colonists
unexpectedly, when a praying Indian warned them
of their danger. This Indian was murdered by three of
Philip's friends, who were found guilty and put to death
for the crime. Not long after this, the Indians attacked
the colonists at Swan´sea, as they were walking home
from church, and killed all those who could not escape in
time to the blockhouse.</p>

<p>As had been agreed beforehand, an alarm was sent right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
away to Plymouth and Boston, where signal fires were
kindled on what is still known as Beacon Hill. An army
of colonists hastily obeyed this summons, and set out to
attack Philip. But the latter was too quick for them, and
managed to escape from his camp at Mount Hope, with
about seven hundred Indians.</p>

<p>Small villages and outlying farmhouses were now in
constant danger; for the savages, gliding along as noiselessly
as snakes, pounced upon the people by day or by
night. They forced their way into the houses, killed and
scalped the men, carried women and children off into captivity,
and left nothing but heaps of smoking ruins behind
them.</p>

<p>In the course of this terrible war, several women were
carried off with all their children. One child&mdash;a tiny
babe&mdash;annoyed one of the savages by crying, so he killed
it in the poor mother's arms. The unhappy woman, too
ill to walk as fast as the Indians wished, was also slain; but
the rest of her children were sold into captivity. In time,
all were rescued, except one little girl, who later married
an Indian, and never saw her family again until she was a
grandmother.</p>

<p>In the course of King Philip's War, which lasted from
1675 till 1678, forty out of ninety English towns suffered
greatly, and thirteen were burned to the ground. Although
there were no great battles,&mdash;except a swamp fight,
in which about one thousand Indians were killed,&mdash;there
were many small engagements, one of the fiercest being
that of Bloody Brook, near Deerfield. It seems that,
owing to an alarm, the village was deserted, but nearly
one hundred men were sent there to save the crops. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
their way back, they carelessly laid their guns in a cart,
and scattered to eat grapes. The Indians, lurking in the
forest in great numbers, took advantage of this to fall upon
them unawares, and seizing their weapons, killed all but a
few of them.</p>

<p>The Indians treated all their captives cruelly, and often
made them suffer horrible tortures. Terrible stories are
told of this time, when many died, and but few captives
escaped. Once, the savages suddenly broke into a house,
and a servant hastily thrust a little child under a big
kettle to hide it from them. The little one kept so very
quiet that the Indians did not know it was there, and later
on it was found unharmed. We are also told that a woman
once drove a party of Indians away by flinging ladlefuls
of boiling soap at them, which made them flee, shrieking
with pain. Another band of Indians, creeping into a
house by way of the chimney, were killed on the hearth,
one after another, by a mother who thus bravely defended
her little ones.</p>

<p>Once, while the people of Hadley were at church, some
Indians came sneaking into the village; but they were seen
by the king-killer Goffe, who happened to be hiding just
then in the minister's house. Rushing out, that white-haired
old man gave the alarm, and led the colonists so
boldly that the Indians were driven away. But as soon as
the danger was over, Goffe again disappeared, and was
never seen in public again, although he is said to have died
at Hadley a few years later, and to have been buried in
the minister's cellar.</p>

<p>All these secret attacks and massacres roused the anger
of the colonists, who finally got the better of their savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
foes. Philip's wife and son fell into their hands, and we
are told that when the Indian chief heard that his child
had been sent to the West Indies, to be sold as a slave, he
bitterly cried: "My heart breaks! I am ready to die."</p>

<p>Shortly after, the camp where he and his tribe were
rapidly starving to death was surrounded by Captain
Church's little army. Philip fled, hoping yet to escape;
but a bullet from an Indian's gun struck him, and "he fell
upon his face in the mud and water, with his gun under
him." When his body was found thus, his head was cut
off, and set up on a pole in Plymouth, where it was kept
for about twenty years. To reward Church for his services
to the colony, the settlers gave him Philip's wampum
belt, which has always been carefully kept as a great curiosity;
and the sword which he handled in King Philip's
War can still be seen in the rooms of the Massachusetts
Historical Society.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXVIII. THE BEGINNING OF NEW YORK.</h2>


<p>Charles II. was such a very merry and easy-going
king that whenever his followers asked him for land
in America, he readily granted it to them. In fact, he
was so free-handed that sometimes he even gave away
what really did not belong to him! Thus, he told his
brother James, Duke of York, that he could have all
the country claimed by the Dutch, saying that it was
English because Cabot had visited it first.</p>

<p>As you will see, this led to trouble; for the Dutch, after
building their first trading post on Manhattan Island, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
1614, had begun to form a colony in the New World. At
first, the Dutch settlers were on very good terms with the
Indians; but, owing mostly to the fire water they so
freely sold, quarrels soon arose.</p>

<p>Seeing this, the Dutchman Min´u-it purchased the whole
of Manhattan Island, in 1626, for about twenty-four dollars'
worth of beads and trinkets. The town on it was called
New Amsterdam, after a great city in Holland, and this
sale, which gave the Dutch land for one sixth of a cent
an acre, was soon followed by many others. Indeed, they
soon owned all the Hudson and Delaware valleys, besides
a strip of coast between the mouths of these two rivers.</p>

<p>Under Governor Kieft, the Indians, exasperated by the
treatment they received, planned to murder all the Dutch.
But a grateful Indian gave a colonist timely warning of
the coming danger. Kieft now tried to make friends with
the redskins, and appointed a meeting with their chiefs on
Long Island. When called upon to state their causes of
complaint, the Indians brought forth a bundle of sticks,
and laying them down, one after another, related a special
wrong for each stick.</p>

<p>Realizing that they had good cause for complaint, Kieft
made a treaty with them, which, however, was soon
broken. Again farms were attacked and settlers were
scalped, and it was only after the number of whites had
been greatly reduced, and more than a thousand Indians
killed, that peace was finally made, in 1645. It was during
this war that Mrs. Hutchinson, who had left Rhode
Island and settled in the western part of Connecticut, was
slain, with all her children except one, who was carried
off into captivity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>To induce people to come and settle in the New Netherlands,&mdash;as
the Dutch called their share of the New World,&mdash;rich
settlers, or patroons, were promised a farm of sixteen
miles' water front, provided they brought out fifty colonists
with the necessary farming tools and stock. The
result of this offer was that many comfortable Dutch
houses arose in the New Netherlands, which soon had
many prosperous settlements, in each of which was a free
school, so the children should not grow up ignorant.</p>

<p>These colonists were simple-hearted, jolly, and fond of
good things to eat. On their numerous holidays they
danced gayly, a pastime which the Puritans considered
very wicked, and they often assembled to help one another
and have a good time. Their principal festivals were held
in honor of St. Nicholas, and on January 1, when they
called upon all their friends to wish them a happy New
Year.</p>

<p>In 1656, about ten years after the Indian troubles ended,
there were about one thousand inhabitants in the city of
New Amsterdam, which stood on the lower part of Manhattan
Island. Protected on three sides by the waters of
the North and East rivers and the Bay, the town was cut
off from the rest of the island by a high palisade running
from shore to shore. This was called the "Wall," and
the place where it once stood is still known as Wall Street.
Beyond this palisade were many farms, among others one
on Bowery Lane, which belonged to Peter Stuȳ´ves-ant,
the fourth governor of the city.</p>

<p>The settlers having been driven away from Fort Nassau,
on the Delaware, by the Indians, some Dutch merchants
soon sent Swedes to form a colony on the spot where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Wil´ming-ton now stands. The country around there was
therefore called New Sweden. But the newcomers could
not live in peace with the Dutch; so Governor Stuyvesant
attacked them, seventeen years later, and took possession
of their town, so that New Sweden ceased to exist.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p145.jpg" width="450" height="374" alt="resist" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Stuyvesant wanted the People to resist.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was while this fighting governor was at the head of
affairs that King Charles's brother James, admiral of the
English navy, first claimed his new territory. His ships
appeared unexpectedly at New Amsterdam, and the astonished
Stuyvesant soon received a letter ordering him to
surrender the city. Although Stuyvesant had but one leg,
he was a brave man, and wanted the people to resist. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
they refused to fight, and made him so angry by their
talk of yielding that he tore the English letter all to pieces.</p>

<p>In spite of his rage, however, New Amsterdam surrendered,
and Stuyvesant had to march out of the town and
return to Holland. The Dutch flag was hauled down
and replaced by the English; but, as the city had been
seized in time of peace, Holland soon showed her displeasure
by declaring war against England. Vessels were
sent out to retake New Amsterdam, which surrendered
the second time as easily as the first, and the Dutch again
ruled over their city.</p>

<p>But when the war was all over, the whole province of
the New Netherlands was given up to the English. New
Amsterdam's name was changed to New York (1664), and
Holland never again claimed any part of our country. But
the Dutch settlers continued to occupy their farms, and
there are many people now in America who proudly claim
descent from the early settlers of the New Netherlands.
Interesting stories are told about the Dutch settlers, the
most famous of all being Washington Irving's tales of
Sleepy Hollow and of Rip Van Winkle.</p>

<p>The Duke of York, owner of all the land in the New
World which had once belonged to Holland, shortly gave
part of it to two of his friends, who called their tracts East
and West New Jersey. The owner of West New Jersey
did not keep his share long, but sold it to some Quakers,
who settled near Bur´ling-ton. East New Jersey was likewise
sold to William Penn and others; but both provinces
were given up to the crown in 1702. New Jersey&mdash;as they
were now called&mdash;was under the same rule as New York&mdash;until
1738, when it became a separate colony.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXXIX. PENN AND THE INDIANS.</h2>


<p>In the meantime, the Friends in England had greatly
increased in number. There were now many rich and
clever people among them besides William Penn, who was
a scholar and a preacher. He had become a Quaker in spite
of all his father's efforts to make him a courtier, for the
elder Penn was an admiral, and a great friend of Charles
II., to whom he lent large sums of money. As the king
could not repay this money, William Penn suggested, after
his father's death, that Charles should give him, instead of
all other payment, a large tract of land in the New World.</p>

<p>Charles was only too happy to clear his debt in such an
easy way. He therefore made Penn a grant of woodland,
which he insisted upon calling Penn-syl-va´ni-a ("Penn's
Woodland"). But we are told that Penn tried to bribe the
clerk to write the name "Sylvania" only, as he thought it
absurd that the land should bear his name. In exchange
for this tract, all the king asked was two beaver skins a
year, and one fifth of all the gold and silver found there.
The land secured, Penn prepared to carry out a long-cherished
plan, which was to found colonies of Friends in the
New World. For that purpose, he had already bought a
share in the West New Jersey colony, and, in 1682, he
crossed over to America himself.</p>

<p>As soon as Penn set foot in West New Jersey, we are told
that the colonists brought him a sod in which was planted
a green twig, to show that he owned the land and all that
grew upon it. Next they presented him with a dish full of
water, because he was master of the seas and rivers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
with the keys of the fort, to indicate that he was in command
of the army and had all the power. Penn graciously
accepted these offerings, and, as you shall see, made a
noble use of his authority over his province. Although
Pennsylvania had been given him by the king, he rightly
considered the Indians the real owners of the soil, and
decided to pay them for it.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p148.jpg" width="450" height="331" alt="penn" />
<div class="caption"><p><small><i>Benjamin West, Artist.</i></small></p>

<p class="center">Penn's Treaty.</p></div>
</div>

<p>He therefore sent for the chiefs, whom he met under a
huge elm. Penn came among the Indians unarmed, and,
after smoking a peace pipe with them, bargained for the
purchase of a large tract of land. Under this elm he also
made a treaty which lasted for more than sixty years,&mdash;"the
only one never sworn to and never broken."</p>

<p>On this occasion Penn made a speech, to which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Indians replied by saying: "We will live in peace with
Penn and his children as long as the moon and the sun
shall endure." Then the two parties exchanged gifts, the
Indians bestowing upon the Quaker a wampum belt on
which a paleface and a redskin were represented hand in
hand. This belt is still carefully kept by the Pennsylvania
Historical Society.</p>

<p>The elm under whose branches this interview took place
was carefully preserved for many years. Even during the
Revolutionary War, sentinels mounted guard over it, so
that none of its branches should be cut off for fire wood.
But in 1810 it was unfortunately blown down, and a
monument, bearing the inscription, "Unbroken faith," now
marks the spot where Penn and the Indians first met.</p>

<p>Before crossing the Atlantic, Penn had written out laws
for his province, granting his people the right to do as
their conscience bade in religious matters, to vote, and to
be tried by a jury of twelve men. He now added that if
there was any trouble between an Indian and a settler, the
case was to be tried by six Indians and six colonists, to
make sure that justice should be equally well meted out to
both parties.</p>

<p>When the Quakers first left England for the New World,
people made great fun of them, declaring that, since the
fighting Puritans, Dutch, and Virginians had such hard
times with the Indians, the Quakers, whose religion forbade
them to return blow for blow, would soon be killed.
They were greatly mistaken, however, for none of the
colonies suffered less from the natives than Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Friends were so gentle that they treated every one
kindly, and a little story will show you how good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
generous even the children were. We are told that a little
girl sat at the door of a log house, one day, eating her
milk porridge. Her mother heard her softly say again
and again: "Now, thee sha'n't;" then, "Keep to thy part."
As no one was near, the mother stole up on tiptoe to find
out to whom the child could be talking. Imagine her
surprise when she saw her little girl sharing her supper
with a big black snake, which ate from one side of the
bowl while she helped herself from the other, patting him
on the head with her spoon whenever he tried to come
over to her side!</p>

<p>It was Penn himself who founded the first town in his
grant. He called it Phil-a-del´phi-a, or the "City of Brotherly
Love," because he wished all the people to live in
peace together, like one family. The first houses were
built of wood; then brick dwellings were seen; and each
cottage was soon surrounded by a neat garden, in which
bloomed gay flowers. Many Germans came over before
long, at Penn's invitation, and settled just north of Philadelphia,
in what is still known as Ger´man-town.</p>

<p>These were joined by other colonists, from different
parts of central Europe; and as the English did not perceive
any difference between the various forms of the German
language and that used in Holland, they generally called
all the newcomers Dutch. These settlers managed to
understand one another, however, by using a strange dialect,
which is still heard in some parts of Pennsylvania,
where it is now known as "Pennsylvania Dutch."</p>

<p>As Pennsylvania had no seacoast of its own, Penn was
glad to buy some land south of him,&mdash;called Del´a-ware,
in honor of one of the governors of Virginia. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
placed his colony on a good footing, Penn went back to
England. He had spent much money in doing this, and
was no longer as rich as he had once been. Besides, his
opinions got him into trouble, and we are told he went
to prison rather than pay what he thought an unjust
debt. For a time he was even deprived of his lands;
but they were finally given back to him, and he and his
heirs ruled Pennsylvania until the Revolution.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p151.jpg" width="450" height="280" alt="swedish" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Old Swedish Church at Wilmington, Delaware.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was within the limits of Delaware that the Dutch, as
we have seen, had built Fort Nassau. They were driven
away by the Indians, and that part of the country belonged
for seventeen years to the Swedes, who called it New
Sweden. At the end of that time, however, it again fell
into the hands of the Dutch, who, about eighteen years
later, finally gave it up to the English, with all the rest of
the New Netherlands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus within less than fifty years Delaware had completely
changed hands four times, when it was purchased
by Penn as seaboard for his state. For a time it was part
of Pennsylvania; but after 1703 it had an assembly of its
own, and it is counted as one of the thirteen famous English
colonies founded in North America.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XL. THE CATHOLICS IN MARYLAND.</h2>


<p>When Henry VIII. made a change in the national
church, many Catholics became discontented, and
longed to leave England and settle elsewhere. Later,
Lord Bal´ti-more decided to make a home for Catholics
in the New World. As Newfoundland, where he tried
to plant his first colony, proved too cold, he came to Virginia,
in 1629. But the Virginians, being Church of England
people, refused to receive any Catholics in their midst.</p>

<p>Thus driven away from Virginia, Lord Baltimore crossed
to the opposite side of the Po-tō´mac. He asked for a
grant of land here, which was given, in 1634, to his son.
He promised to pay the king two Indian arrows every
year, with one fifth of all the gold and silver he found.
This tract was called Ma´ry-land, in honor of the Catholic
Queen Henrietta Maria, and prosperous settlements were
made at St. Marys and at An-nap´o-lis. Unlike their
Protestant neighbors, these Catholic colonists would not
allow any one to be persecuted for religion, and as all
except Jews could vote, people of every faith soon came
thither, and Maryland was rapidly settled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>This colony, however, had its troubles, too. There was
first a quarrel with Virginia, and then several Indian wars;
and when William became King of England, he took the
government away from its Catholic proprietor. But later
on, Baltimore's heirs, having turned Protestant, recovered
their rights, and were left in control of the whole province
until the time of the Revolution. Maryland's chief city,
Baltimore, was founded about 1729. It was named in
honor of the Catholic founder of the colony, and it still
contains thousands of faithful Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>Owing to mistakes made in drawing up the different
grants, the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland
became a cause for disputes which lasted about fifty
years. Several times surveyors were sent out from England
to settle the quarrel, and the line they finally drew is
generally known as the Mason and Dixon line. At the
end of every mile, these surveyors set up a stone post,
bearing on either side the initial of the colony it faced;
and every five miles, a larger pillar, with the arms of both
families, the Penns and the Baltimores.</p>

<p>While all the changes we have been describing were
thus taking place in the rest of the New World, Virginia
had not been standing still. Indeed, it had prospered so
greatly that it had become the most important of all the
colonies. But its progress was interrupted several times.
For instance, three years after the founding of the House
of Burgesses, a quarrel between an Indian and a settler
ended in a murder, which brought about an Indian war.</p>

<p>Powhatan, who had vowed that the sky should fall
before the Indians broke peace with the Virginians, was
now dead. The savages, hating to see their former hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and fishing grounds occupied by the planters, now
attacked the scattered settlements, and murdered men,
women, and children. Even Jamestown itself would have
been surprised, and all the colonists slain, had not a
friendly Indian given the people timely warning.</p>

<p>Terrified by this Indian outbreak, the colonists no
longer dared occupy their plantations, and either crowded
into a few of the towns or went back to England. In a
short time the colony thus found itself reduced by half,
although the Indians were beaten in the war. Some years
later, seeing that the Indians were rising again, and that
nothing but severe measures could save the settlement,
another war was begun, and all the hostile Indians were
either driven away or slain.</p>

<p>When King James I. heard that the colony was failing, he
fancied that the trouble arose from poor laws and bad government;
so he took away the Virginia charter, and made
the colony a royal province, in 1624. But although he
boasted that he would soon make new and better laws for
Virginia, he never did so. His son and successor, Charles,
after whom one of the capes at the entrance of Chesapeake
Bay had been named by the first settlers, also found too
much to do at home to trouble himself about the Virginians,
who were sorely tried by tyrannical governors.</p>

<p>Still, although they lived on the other side of the Atlantic
Ocean, the colonists loudly insisted that they had the
rights of free-born Englishmen. They therefore said that
the governors the king sent over could not tax them or
make new laws, except through the House of Burgesses.
But as the governors would not always agree to this, quarrels
arose, which gradually became more and more bitter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2>XLI. THE OLD DOMINION.</h2>


<p>It was while Governor Berke´ley ruled Virginia that
Puritan England revolted against and beheaded King
Charles I.; and soon after that they made Cromwell Protector
of the new republic, or Commonwealth, of England.
When these tidings came to Virginia, many of the colonists
were indignant. Just as in England, the people
sided for or against the king, the Puritans being called
"Roundheads," while the Royalists claimed the title of
"Cav-a-liers´."</p>

<p>The latter were by far the more numerous in Virginia,
and as they prided themselves upon their great loyalty,
they invited Charles II., son of the beheaded king, to
come over and rule their colony, which they now affectionately
called "the Old Dominion." Charles did not
accept this invitation, and Parliament, deciding that the
colony should obey England, sent out a new governor.
The latter, upon arriving in Virginia, declared that, according
to the new Navigation Act, Virginia, like all the rest
of the colonies, would have to send its produce to England
in English ships.</p>

<p>This law was very unjust, and the English captains who
came into the bays and up the rivers for cargoes, now
charged higher rates to carry produce to England. They
could not get good prices for it in England, had to pay
high prices for the goods they bought there, and, besides,
asked heavy freight rates for bringing these goods back
to the planters in Virginia. The colonists thus got little in
exchange for their tobacco and other produce. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
also greatly annoyed, for even the goods they wished to
send to the neighboring colonies, or to the West Indies,
had to be carried first to England and then back again,
unless they paid a heavy duty.</p>

<p>This was unfair, and the Virginians did not like it. Still,
it did not prevent their colony from increasing rapidly, for
many of the Royalists, finding life unbearable under Puritan
government in England, came out to America. Here
they talked a great deal of the royal family, prided themselves
upon being true to the exiled king, and when the
news finally came that Cromwell was dead (1658), many
Virginia planters openly rejoiced.</p>

<p>Two years later, the royal family was restored in England,
and the House of Burgesses recalled Governor
Berkeley, who had ruled there in the days of Charles I.
But the Burgesses warned him that, while they were loyal
subjects of the king, they were fully determined to make
their own laws, and that his duty would consist mainly in
seeing that these were duly obeyed.</p>

<p>Although the colonists thought their troubles would
end when the king had come to the throne, they soon
found out that Charles II. was a worse master than Cromwell.
Always in need of money, the king not only kept
up the hated Navigation Act, but, as Virginia had become
the property of the crown in 1624, he now made a present
of it to two of his friends, Lords Cul´pep-per and Ar´lington
(1673), telling them they might keep it for thirty-one
years, and have all the money they could make from it.</p>

<p>These two noblemen, hearing that there were about
forty thousand people in the Old Dominion, fancied they
would be able to tax them as much as they pleased; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the colonists, who were proud of their rights and homes,
grumbled at this change of owners, and said they would
obey no one except the king.</p>

<p>Jamestown was then the only city in Virginia; but each
plantation formed a small colony by itself, and people
traveling from place to place were always hospitably
entertained in the houses they passed. The estates were
so large and scattered that there were very few schools;
but the richest colonists hired private tutors for their
children, and sent their sons to the English universities to
complete their education. In this, Virginia was different
from the Northern colonies, and the greater part of her
people were ignorant. Thinking they would therefore
be easier to rule, a Virginia governor once boasted of
the fact that they had neither printing press nor free
schools, and added that he hoped they would not have
any for the next hundred years!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XLII. BACON'S REBELLION.</h2>


<p>IN the midst of the trouble caused in Virginia by the
change of owners, and the increased taxes they imposed,
the Indians, who had been quiet for about thirty
years, suddenly came back. They said that while they
had sold the land to the English, they still had the right
to fish and hunt wherever they pleased. A dispute about
this question again resulted in a murder, which&mdash;for history
often repeats itself&mdash;occasioned another war.</p>

<p>Since Berkeley took no steps to defend them from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
savages, who boldly attacked outlying plantations, the
Virginians determined to act themselves, and chose Nathaniel
Bacon as their leader. But Berkeley declared
they were rebels, and hearing that they had started, he
would have pursued them, could he have raised troops.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p158.jpg" width="450" height="393" alt="bacon" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Bacon's Rebellion.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the Virginian army came
home in triumph from the first brush
with the Indians, Bacon was called before the governor
and tried as a rebel. But the jury promptly acquitted
him, to Berkeley's great disgust. The governor waited
until war broke out again, and when Bacon was too busy
fighting to offer any resistance, he declared him an outlaw.
This accusation, added to grievances about the taxes,
caused a short civil war in Virginia, during which Jamestown
was seized by the rebels, and Berkeley fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>But the governor returned as soon as Bacon was called
away, and prepared to defend himself in Jamestown.
Hearing of this, Bacon came back, ready to lay siege to
the city. The angry governor ordered out the cannon to
shoot the rebels;
but we are told
that Bacon, having
captured the
wives of Berkeley's
men, now
put these women
in front of
his little force,
knowing their
presence there
would prevent
any bloodshed.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/illus_p159.jpg" width="375" height="502" alt="ruins" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Ruins of Jamestown.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus routed
by a "white-apron
brigade,"
Berkeley fled a
second time;
and Bacon, fearing
he might return
and fortify
the city, burned Jamestown to the ground (1676). The
first English city built in the United States thus became
a heap of ruins, and no trace of it now remains, except a
small part of the old church tower and a few gravestones.</p>

<p>Shortly after the burning of Jamestown, Bacon fell ill
and died, his followers sadly crying: "Who is there now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to plead our cause?" Their helpless grief was so great
that Berkeley took advantage of it to return. He then
began to punish all those who had taken any part in what
is known in history as "Bacon's Rebellion," or the "Great
Rebellion" in Virginia.</p>

<p>In fact, Berkeley showed himself so cruel that many of
those who had borne arms were condemned to die. Once,
when a prisoner whom he particularly hated was brought
before him, he angrily cried: "You are very welcome; I
am more glad to see you than any man in Virginia; you
shall be hanged in half an hour." This prisoner was executed,
and so many others shared his fate that King
Charles, hearing how Berkeley abused his power, indignantly
cried: "The old fool has taken away more lives in
that naked country than I for the murder of my father."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XLIII. A JOURNEY INLAND.</h2>


<p>When Berkeley was called back to England in disgrace,
none of the Virginians were sorry to see him
leave. But the new governor sent out by the owners was
no better, for he laid such heavy taxes upon the people
that the king finally had to take back the gift he had made
to his friends. Virginia, therefore, once more became a
royal province. But shortly after, King Charles died, and
his Catholic brother, James, had to put down a rebellion
in England before he could occupy the throne in peace.
James was very resentful; so many of those who had taken
up arms against him were sentenced by a harsh English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
judge to be shipped to Virginia and sold there as slaves
for a term of ten years.</p>

<p>But although both king and judge had decreed that none
of these poor prisoners should be allowed to buy their
freedom, the Virginians generously set them at liberty as
soon as they landed. The governor, seeing it would make
trouble if he tried to oppose the Virginians in this, made
no great objection, and after that no white men were ever
sold as slaves in America.</p>

<p>Before long, too, another improvement was made; for
the Virginians, feeling that it was necessary to have a
college of their own, sent a messenger to England for a
charter. Although the king's ministers swore at this
man at first, and told him that Virginians ought to think
of nothing but tobacco, permission was finally granted, on
condition that two copies of Latin verse should be sent to
England every year. The college thus founded&mdash;the
second in our country&mdash;was called William and Mary, in
honor of the king and queen who succeeded James II. in
1688.</p>

<p>Some years later, Governor Spots´wood built himself
a beautiful house in Virginia, which he ornamented with
large mirrors. But the woods were still so thick there
that we are told a deer strayed into the parlor one day.
Catching a glimpse of his reflection in a tall mirror, he
rushed up to the glass and dashed it to pieces with his
horns!</p>

<p>This same Spotswood was of an adventurous turn of
mind, and wishing to see what lay beyond the Blue Ridge
Mountains, he once set out on a journey of exploration.
It is said that he and his jolly companions crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
both the Blue Ridge and the Al´le-gha-nies, coming home
after a ride of about one thousand miles, delighted with
the beautiful country they had found on the other side of
the mountains.</p>

<p>They sent such a glowing account of this journey to
King George I. that he knighted Spotswood, giving him
a coat of arms bearing a golden horseshoe. Some writers
add that, in memory of this long ride, Spotswood founded
an order of knighthood in Virginia, which included all
those who had made part of the expedition, and their
direct descendants.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XLIV. THE CAROLINA PIRATES.</h2>


<p>You remember, do you not, how Raleigh tried and
failed to plant a colony on Roanoke Island, in what
is now North Carolina? For about seventy-five years
after this, that part of the country was left to the Indians
and the few settlers who strayed there from Virginia. But
in 1663 Charles II. gave a large tract of land to several
of his favorites, who were called the lords proprietors.
To flatter the king, they named the country Carolina, the
very name which the French had given it many years
before, in honor of their monarch, Charles IX.</p>

<p>Now, the lords proprietors wanted to make this colony
different from all the rest by placing all the power in the
hands of the rich and noble, as was arranged by a code
of laws drawn up by John Locke. But these laws could
never be used, and to induce people to settle in Carolina
at all, the lords proprietors had to promise them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
large tracts of land, freedom of thought, and a share in
making the laws.</p>

<p>This granted, Quakers, Huguenots, Puritans, Scotch,
Irish, English, Swiss, Germans, and Dutch came there in
great numbers. In the north, the colonists devoted themselves
to lumbering, tobacco-raising, and the production
of tar, pitch, and turpentine; but in the south, they grew
a great deal of rice, indigo, and tobacco, and many sweet
potatoes.</p>

<p>At first, the French Huguenots tried to raise silkworms
in their new colony; but they soon had to give up
this attempt, because the climate proved too damp. Still,
although unfavorable for silkworms, Carolina proved just
right for the growing of rice. The first seed was brought
to the governor of Charles´ton by a Mad-a-gas´car ship
captain, who bade him plant it in marshy soil. There the
rice grew so well that before long all the swamps were
turned into rice fields, and Carolina rice is now famous in
all parts of the country.</p>

<p>Some fifty years later, a planter's daughter tried to raise
indigo. After several failures, she succeeded in doing so,
and indigo was raised in Carolina until the time came
when cotton paid better. Thanks to its rice, tobacco,
indigo, and marine supplies, Carolina became so rich and
prosperous that, although it was the twelfth English colony,
it soon outstripped several of the rest. The Carolina
planters, growing rich, bought many negroes to work their
large tracts of land, and spent the greater part of the year
at Charleston, where they led a gay life and entertained
a great deal.</p>

<p>Carolina was also noted for her bold seamen, for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
along the coast there were many small harbors, in which
pirates could hide. They sailed out of these places to
attack vessels on their way to and from the West Indies,
and often secured much booty. The best known of all
the Carolina pirates was Blackbeard. Like Captain Kidd
of New England, he is supposed to have buried great
treasures in the sand along the coast, and there are still
people foolish enough to try to find them.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, who still held Florida, had always been
jealous of the English. When the latter came to settle in
Carolina and Georgia, the Spaniards, hoping to drive them
away, stirred up the Indians to war against them, and
sometimes took part in the fights themselves. Besides,
many disputes arose about the boundaries, both parties
being equally inclined to claim all the land they could.</p>

<p>In 1729 the lords proprietors ceased to have any control
over their lands, which, divided into North and South
Carolina, became two royal provinces. These prospered
much during the following years, and by the time the
Revolutionary War began, North Carolina ranked fourth
in importance among the colonies.</p>

<p>We have now seen how twelve of the English colonies
were planted on our coast, and before traveling northward
once more, to see how New England was getting along,
you shall hear how the thirteenth and last colony was
founded, in 1733.</p>

<p>James O´gle-thorpe, a kind-hearted Englishman, perceiving
the suffering of debtors, who were then imprisoned
like criminals, longed to give them a chance to begin life
over again. Thinking they could best do this in the New
World, he asked George II. for a tract of land there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
promising to hold it in trust for the poor. This territory
was called Georgia, in honor of the king; and Oglethorpe,
having assembled his colonists, sailed for America.</p>

<p>Arriving at Charleston, he went southward and founded
the city of Sa-van´nah. Before doing so, however, he had
an interview with the Indians of that section, from whom
he bought the land. In exchange for his gifts, they presented
him with a buffalo robe lined with eagle feathers,
saying: "The eagle signifies swiftness, and the buffalo
strength. The English are swift as a bird to fly over the
vast seas, and as strong as a beast before their enemies.
The eagle's feathers are soft, and signify love; the buffalo's
skin is warm, and means protection: therefore, love and
protect our families."</p>

<p>An attempt to cultivate olive trees and breed silkworms
proved as great a failure in Georgia as in Carolina; but
rice soon became one of the staples of the colony, and the
first fine cotton was raised there from seed brought from
India. Oglethorpe, wishing to give his colony a good
start, said that neither rum nor slaves should be allowed
within its limits. But some of his colonists were displeased
at this, although both Oglethorpe and John
Wesley&mdash;the founder of the Methodist Church&mdash;tried to
convince them that they would be far better off if they
did their own work and kept sober. Shortly after the
visit of the Wesley brothers, White´field also came out to
visit the Georgia colony, where he supported the first
orphan asylum built in our country.</p>

<p>In 1739, war having broken out between England and
Spain, Oglethorpe led a small army of Georgians into Florida,
to besiege St. Augustine. To punish the Georgians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
for this attempt to take their city, the Spaniards invaded
their land three years later, but only to be defeated at
the battle of Fred-er-i´ca. When these troubles came to
an end, Oglethorpe went back to England. But even
before his departure people began to change the laws, and
in a few years they introduced both rum and slavery.
Although Oglethorpe gave up Georgia to the king in
1752, he took a great interest in the settlement he had
founded, and as he lived to be very old, he saw it join
the other colonies in 1776, for it was one of the famous
thirteen.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XLV. CHARTER OAK.</h2>


<p>After King Philip's War was over in New England,
Charles II. turned his attention to the colony of Massachusetts
Bay, where four things did not suit him. The
Navigation Law, which applied to all the colonies, was not
kept in Massachusetts; there were many quarrels between
that colony and the settlements in Maine; Massachusetts
would not have an Episcopal church; and it had coined
money. To punish the colony for these things, Charles
took away its charter (1679), and said that thereafter New
Hampshire should form a separate royal province.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts people were, of course, angry at
being deprived of their charter; still, they managed to
keep the money they had minted. These coins bore on
one side a rudely stamped pine tree. Charles having asked
to see one of them, the man who showed it to him carefully
explained that the picture represented the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Oak, whose branches had concealed the king when Cromwell's
soldiers were seeking for him. This clever explanation
so amused the merry monarch that he allowed Massachusetts
to retain its "pine-tree shillings." We are also
told that the mint master was allowed a certain number of
these coins as pay. When his daughter married, he made
her sit down in one scale, filled the other with "pine-tree
shillings" till the scales balanced, and gave her with this
dowry to his new son-in-law, telling him he now had a
wife who was really worth her weight in silver.</p>

<p>When James II. came to the throne, he sent Governor
An´dros to rule over New England and New York. This
man, wishing to make sure all the power would be in his
hands, tried to get hold of the charters of the colonies.
But when he asked the people of Rhode Island to give
up theirs, they gravely answered they did not have any.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p167.jpg" width="250" height="179" alt="oak" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Charter Oak.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Next, he went to Hartford and asked the Connecticut
Assembly to surrender their charter. The people, unwilling
to give it up, argued
about the matter until it
grew so dark that candles
had to be brought into
the room. Seeing that
the governor would yet
compel them to obey his
orders, a patriot, Captain
Wadsworth, suddenly
flung his cloak over the
candles, and taking advantage of the darkness and confusion,
seized the charter, which he cleverly hid in a hollow
oak. This tree stood in Hartford until 1856, when it blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
down; but the spot where the Charter Oak once stood is
now marked by a monument.</p>

<p>As there were no matches in those days, it took time to
relight the candles; but as soon as that was done, Andros
again demanded the charter. No trace of it could now be
found. Andros, in a rage, then called for the record
books of the colony, and writing <i>Finis</i> ("The End") at
the bottom of the page, declared he would rule Connecticut
without any charter at all.</p>

<p>He next proceeded to Boston, where he made the
people equally angry by insisting upon holding Episcopal
services in the Old South Church, by laying extra
taxes upon them to pay for the building of a fine new
chapel, and by trying to assume all the power. His
tyrannical ways finally made the Bostonians so indignant
that they put him in prison.</p>

<p>Some of the governor's friends, who were called Tories,
because they sided with the king, now tried to rescue
him. They cleverly smuggled women's garments into
the prison, and Governor Andros, dressed like a lady,
would have gotten out of prison safely had not his big feet
roused the suspicions of the guard. Shortly after, he was
sent to England to be tried, and although he later governed
Virginia, he never came back to New England. His master,
James II., being as much disliked in England as Andros
was in the colonies, had meanwhile been driven out of the
country, where his son-in-law and daughter, William and
Mary, came to reign in his stead (1688).</p>

<p>The New England people, like most of the English,
were delighted with this change of masters. They had
cause to be, for Connecticut and Rhode Island were now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
allowed to keep their old charters, while Massachusetts
received a new one, by which the Plymouth colony and
Maine were added to it, and by which the right to vote
and partly govern themselves was assured to the people.</p>

<p>But we are told that Governor Fletcher, who ruled over
Connecticut after Andros, had so little respect for its
charter that he once went to Hartford to assume command
over the militia there. He, too, was met by Captain
Wadsworth, who, having called out his men as requested,
bade them beat the drums every time the governor tried
to have his orders read.</p>

<p>This scene must have been very funny; for while the
governor roared, "Silence!" Wadsworth loudly cried,
"Drum! drum, I say!" Finally the captain laid his hand
on his sword, saying very firmly: "If I am interrupted
again, I will make the sun shine through you in a minute."
Frightened by this threat, Governor Fletcher returned in
haste to New York, and never made another attempt to
tamper with the Connecticut charter.</p>

<p>At about the same time an interesting meeting was
held by several Connecticut ministers at New Haven.
They had decided they needed a new school, so each man
brought a few books, which he laid down on the table,
saying they were his contribution to the new institution.
This school was held in different places at first, but in
1718 it took the name of Yale College, because a man of
that name gave some books and money for its use.</p>

<p>A few of the old Tories, both in England and America,
remained faithful to the banished James, and among them
was the governor of New York. When William and Mary
were proclaimed rulers, this governor fled, leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
colony without any head. Leīs´ler, a patriotic citizen,
knowing the French and Indians in the north would take
advantage of this state of affairs to invade the province,
now rallied his friends around him, and with their help
began to govern for William and Mary.</p>

<p>But as Albany at first refused to obey Leisler, there
was some trouble and bloodshed. Soon a messenger came
over from England, to say that the king and queen were
going to send over a new governor, named Sloughter. This
messenger bade Leisler, in the meantime, give up the power
to him; but the patriot refused to do so, and surrendered
it only to Sloughter when he finally came.</p>

<p>Because of this refusal, Leisler and eight of his friends
were accused of treason, and sentenced to death. But
Sloughter, feeling that the trial had been hardly fair, would
not sign their death warrants, so they could not be put to
death. Leisler's foes, therefore, had to wait until a dinner
party took place, when they made the drunken governor
sign the papers, and hanged Leisler. A few years later,
the whole affair was brought before Parliament, which declared
that Leisler had died innocent, and paid his family
a certain sum of money because he had been wrongfully
accused and killed.</p>

<h2>XLVI. SALEM WITCHES.</h2>


<p>About four years after the Revolution of 1688, in
England, arose the Salem witchcraft delusion, which
you will now hear about. In olden times, as you have
seen, people had very few and poor chances of learning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
compared with what you have now. Almost everybody
then believed in witches. These were supposed to be
persons who had sold their souls to Satan, could ride
through the air on broomsticks, make others ill by looking
at them with an evil eye, cast a spell upon cattle, houses,
or furniture, and, in short, do all sorts of impossible
things.</p>

<p>As you know, some children have very lively imaginations,
and hearing people talk of such things as seriously
as if they were quite true, a few children in Salem, Massachusetts,
began to fancy they must be bewitched, because
they were not quite well and had fits. The grown-up
people, who should have known better and merely given
the children medicine to cure their illness, believed these
youngsters, and anxiously inquired who could have cast a
spell upon them.</p>

<p>The children, remembering that their elders often spoke
of the witches as old, first began to talk of such and such
a woman who had looked at them crossly or threatened to
beat them with her staff when they played tricks upon
her. These poor old creatures, who were really in their
second childhood, and not responsible for what they said
or did, were put into prison, and tortured in many cruel
ways, so as to force them to confess that they were witches.
Bewildered, and hoping to get free, some of the poor old
creatures finally acknowledged that they were witches.</p>

<p>Almost everybody believed in witchcraft at that time,
and for many years supposed witches had been treated
with great cruelty in Europe. When persons accused of
witchcraft refused to confess, some people thought that
the only way to find out the truth was to throw them into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the water. If the victims sank, it was said they could not
be witches, but if they swam, it was considered a sure sign
that they had sold themselves to the Evil One, and they
were sentenced to death, either by hanging, burning, or
torture. But this was, after all, only a choice of deaths, for
the poor creatures who sank were allowed to remain under
water so long, to make sure they were innocent, that
they were generally dead when taken out.</p>

<p>Persons who were only suspected of witchcraft were put
in the stocks, fastened to the pillory, whipped at the cart
tail, or placed on the ducking stool, or had their ears
chopped off. These were punishments often applied to
criminals in those days, and if you care to see pictures
of pillory, stocks, and ducking stool, you can find them
in any large dictionary. Both men and women were accused
of witchcraft in Salem, and one of the men was put
to death by a torture called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peine forte et dure</i>, by which
he was slowly crushed under a thick door, upon which
tremendous weights were laid. He was, fortunately, the
only person in our country who was ever punished in this
inhuman way.</p>

<p>Nearly one hundred and fifty people of all kinds were
arrested for witchcraft in Salem, and nineteen of them, after
being tried by a court, were found guilty and put to death.
But people finally saw that it was all folly, and even the
learned minister, Cotton Math´er, who had believed in
witches just like the rest, had to own that he had been mistaken.
The children were now punished when they pretended
to be under a spell, and the Salem witchcraft
delusion came to an end. Ever since then, no one with a
grain of sense has believed in witches; but you will often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
hear people speak of the terrible time they had in Salem
while the belief in them lasted. The building shown in
the picture was one of the houses of Salem at that time;
and it is still pointed out there as "the witch house."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 375px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Salem Witch House.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mather, the
famous "Patriarch
of New
England," who
believed in
witches, was a
very learned
man. He wrote
more books
than there are
days in the
year, and was
so busy that
he wrote over
his door, "Be short," so that people should not take up
his time with idle talk. In one of his books he once read
that smallpox could be prevented by vaccination. He told
this to Boylston, a Boston doctor, who tried it on his own
son and servants. But when the Bos-to´ni-ans first heard
of it, they were so indignant that they wanted to kill
Boylston.</p>

<p>In time, however, people saw that the doctor was right,
and ever since vaccination has been practiced, few people
have died of the disease which once swept away whole
families. Because Boylston went ahead and did what was
right, in spite of people's threats, he is now greatly honored,
and a fine street in Boston bears his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>




<h2>XLVII. DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI.</h2>


<p>While the English were planting thirteen colonies
along the Atlantic seaboard, between Nova Scotia
and Florida, the French were equally busy farther north.
As we have seen, Breton fishermen visited the banks of
Newfoundland early in the sixteenth century, and gave
their name to Cape Breton Island. Verrazano and Cartier
both crossed the Atlantic in behalf of the French, Cartier
naming the St. Lawrence, Canada, and Montreal, and
claiming all Acadia (the land east of Maine), together
with New France, which was situated in the basin of the
Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.</p>

<p>Religious troubles had, as we have also seen, led Coligny
to try to plant colonies in Carolina and Florida.
But the Huguenot settlers were murdered by the Spaniards,
and the attempt of De Monts (maw<span class="smcap">N</span>) to establish
a colony in Maine proved equally unsuccessful. The first
real settlement of the French was made at Port Royal
(Annapolis), in Acadia (Nova Scotia), in 1604. This
colony, composed of thrifty people, in time became prosperous,
and the Acadians lived in peace and comfort in
their new homes, being on excellent terms with all the
neighboring Indians.</p>

<p>In 1608, Champlain (sham-plān´), the "Father of New
France," a noble, brave, and good Frenchman, crossed
the Atlantic for the fourth time. He sailed far up the St.
Lawrence, and made a settlement at Quebec, which soon
became the chief French town in America. Champlain
explored the country for hundreds of miles around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
there. He was the first European to behold the lake which
bears his name, the same year that Hudson sailed up the
river to Albany (1609). During these explorations of
New France, Champlain
made friends with the
Al-gon´quin Indians, the
great foes of the Ir-o-quois´ (or Five Nations), who occupied
all the central part of what is now New York state.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p175.jpg" width="450" height="391" alt="quebec" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Old Quebec.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Algonquin Indians, being at war with the Iroquois,
persuaded Champlain to help them. His presence in
armor in the next battle, and the report of European firearms,
so terrified the Iroquois that they were badly beaten
on the shore of Lake Champlain. This ever after made
them hate the French as cordially as they did their lifelong
enemies, the Algonquin Indians. To be able to cope with
the latter, who easily got firearms from French traders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the Iroquois began to buy guns from the Dutch; for their
usual weapons, tomahawk and bow and arrows, were far
less effective than firearms.</p>

<p>The French had come to Quebec with two great purposes
in view: the first, to trade for furs, and the second,
to convert the Indians. The colonists were, therefore,
either trappers, traders, or missionaries. The former
went about from place to place to set their traps or trade
with the Indians, and were therefore called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i>
(travelers), or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coureurs de bois</i> (wood rangers). Finding
the European dress unsuited to the rough life they led,
these men soon adopted a half-Indian costume of soft
deerskin, and learned many of the woodland ways of the
redskins.</p>

<p>Wherever the trappers and traders went, priests boldly
followed, carrying only a crucifix, a prayer book, and
sometimes a portable altar. They diligently taught,
preached, and baptized, making every effort to learn the
Indian languages as quickly as possible, so they could
preach the gospel and win more converts. Full of zeal
for their religion, these missionaries were so brave that
they soon won the respect of the Indians; and when the
latter saw how quietly the priests endured hardships of
all kinds, they lent an attentive ear to their teachings.</p>

<p>Both traders and priests were on very friendly terms
with the Indians, whose good will they retained by living
among them and by making them frequent small presents.
As the French hunters considered the Indians their equals,
they soon married squaws, and their children, being half
Indian and half French, strengthened the bonds between
the two races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Little by little, priests and traders pressed farther and
farther inland, visiting the Great Lakes, along whose
shores they established missions, forts, and trading posts.
Finally, they came to what are now Il-li-nois´ and Wis-con´sin,
where many places still bear the French names
then given them.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of all these French traders was
Joliet (zho-le-ā´). Not only was he thoroughly at home
in the trackless forests, but he could also talk several
Indian languages. Hearing the savages tell of a great
river flowing southward, he fancied that it must empty
into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Joliet had long been the companion of Marquette (mar-ket´),
a Catholic priest, so they two resolved to go and
explore that region. But the Indians tried to frighten
them by telling them there were awful monsters on the
"Father of Waters," which swallowed men and canoes.</p>

<p>Fron´te-nac, the governor of New France, having consented
to this journey, Marquette and Joliet met at the
outlet of Lake Mich´i-gan (map, page 322), paddled up to
Green Bay, and went up the Fox River. Then their Indian
guides carried their canoes across to the Wisconsin River,
where, bidding them farewell, the trader, priest, and five
voyageurs drifted down the stream to the Mississippi.
This was in 1673. Sailing southward for many miles,
without seeing a single human being, the explorers came
to huge cliffs upon which the Indians had painted rude
demons; then they beheld wide prairies and great herds of
buffaloes on the right bank of the river.</p>

<p>Some distance farther on they saw a path, and, following
it, they came to an Indian village. When the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
saw the white men draw near, the chief came out to welcome
them, shading his eyes with his hand, and saying:
"Frenchmen, how bright the sun shines when you come
to visit us!" To honor his guests, he had a feast of buffalo
meat and fish prepared, and fed the strangers with a huge
wooden spoon, just as if they were babies. Other Indians
removed fish bones for them with their fingers, blew on
their food to cool it, and from time to time poked choice
bits into their mouths. As these were Indian good manners,
Marquette and Joliet submitted as gracefully as they
could. But it seems that it hurt their host's feelings when
they refused to taste his best dish, a fat dog nicely roasted!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p178.jpg" width="450" height="267" alt="joliet" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Marquette and Joliet come to an Indian Village.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After spending the night with these Indians, Joliet and
Marquette were escorted back to their canoes. Paddling
on, they next came to the place where the Missouri joins
the Mississippi. The waters of the Missouri were both
swift and muddy, and whirled whole trees along as easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
as mere chips. After passing the mouth of the Ohio,
the explorers saw Indians armed with guns and hatchets,
which proved they were near European settlements.</p>

<p>Fully convinced by this time that the Mississippi flowed
into the Gulf of Mexico, and not into the Pacific Ocean,
as they had first supposed, and anxious to make this fact
known at Quebec, the explorers turned back, south of the
mouth of the Arkansas (ar´kan-saw). They had thus
reached nearly the same place which De Soto had visited
about one hundred and thirty-two years before. Slowly
paddling upstream, they now worked their way up the
Illinois River, and carried their canoes overland to the
Chicago (she-caw´go) River, through which they reëntered
Lake Michigan, after eighteen months' journey.</p>

<p>Marquette staid at a mission on Green Bay for a
while, then journeyed to the Illinois, and when spring
came again, he made an effort to get back to Mich-i-li-mack´i-nac.
But he became so ill that before long he
had to be carried ashore, and laid under a tree, where he
breathed his last, and was buried.</p>

<p>Meantime, Joliet hastened back to Montreal to make
his report to the governor. His canoe upset, and his
plans and papers were lost, but the news he brought made
the French anxious to secure the land by building trading
forts along the rivers that had been explored.</p>

<p>It is because Marquette and Joliet were the first white
men who visited this part of the country, that their names
have been given to a port and county at the northern end
of Lake Michigan, and to a town in Illinois. They were
such bold explorers that beautiful monuments have also
been erected in their honor.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>




<h2>XLVIII. LA SALLE'S ADVENTURES.</h2>


<p>In the meantime, another French explorer, La Salle
(lah sahl´), had also been at work, and had discovered
the Ohio River. In 1679, six years after Marquette and
Joliet sailed down the Mississippi, La Salle came to the
Illinois River, where he built Fort Crèvecœur (crāv´ker)
("heartbreak"), near the place occupied by the present city
of Pe-o´ri-a.</p>

<p>La Salle next went back to Canada for supplies, and
reached Montreal only by means of much paddling and a
long tramp of a thousand miles. But he left orders with
a priest, named Hen´ne-pin, to explore the upper part of
the Mississippi River. Father Hennepin, therefore, went
down the Illinois, and then paddled upstream to the Falls
of St. An´tho-ny, in 1680. His adventures were very
exciting, for he fell into the hands of the Sioux (soo)
Indians. Long after he got back to Europe, he claimed
to have been the first to sail all the way down the Mississippi;
but this honor is now generally believed to belong
to La Salle.</p>

<p>When La Salle came back to Crèvecœur a year later, he
found his fort in ruins; most of his men had deserted. At
first he thought that his few faithful followers had been
killed by the Indians, but his fears were quieted when they
joined him at Michilimackinac.</p>

<p>In 1681 La Salle again set out, with his lieutenant Ton´ty
and a band of Indians, for the southern end of Lake Michigan.
Sailing up the Chicago, he had his canoes carried
across to the Illinois River. It was the Indians who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
taught the white men thus to pass from one stream to
another, and to avoid falls and rapids. These carrying
places received from the French explorers the name of
"portage," by which they are still known, even though no
one now thinks of using them for that purpose.</p>

<p>Sailing down the Illinois and Mississippi, La Salle
reached the mouth of the latter stream in 1682. As was
the custom with explorers of every nation, he solemnly
took possession, in the name of his king, of the river and
the land it drained. This territory, as you can see on
your map, included most of the region between the Rocky
and Alleghany Mountains, the Great Lakes, and the Gulf
of Mexico; it was called Lou-i-si-a´na, in honor of Louis
XIV. of France.</p>

<p>Arriving at Quebec, after meeting with many adventures,
La Salle told Frontenac that France ought to make
good her claim to the land by building trading posts at
intervals all along the principal streams. He added that
it was also necessary to have a fort at the mouth of the
Mississippi, and soon after went to France to tell the king
about his discoveries, and ask for help.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. gave La Salle several ships loaded with
supplies; and a small army of colonists having joined him,
the explorer set out. His fleet reached the Gulf of Mexico
in 1684; but, owing to some mistake, it sailed past the
mouth of the Mississippi without seeing it. As the captain
would not believe La Salle and turn back, they coasted
on until they finally landed at Mat-a-gor´da Bay, in Texas.</p>

<p>Here a fort was built; but the spot proved so unhealthful
that many colonists died. The ships having gone back,
run aground, or been dashed to pieces, the French could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
not get away again by sea. La Salle therefore decided to
set out on foot, so as to join Tonty and obtain more supplies
for his unhappy colony.</p>

<p>As had been agreed, Tonty had come down the Mississippi
to meet La Salle. But after waiting vainly for him
several months, he went northward again, leaving a letter
in the fork of a tree, and telling the Indians to give it to
the first white man they saw. Long before reaching
this place, La Salle's men became angry because their
expedition had been a failure. They blamed their leader
for all their sufferings, and, falling upon him unawares,
basely murdered the man who is known as the "father
of French colonization in the Mississippi valley."</p>

<p>Although La Salle was dead, his plan was too good to
be abandoned. Some thirteen years later, therefore, a
Frenchman named Iberville (e-ber-veel´) came out from
France to found a fort at the mouth of the Mississippi.
He sailed up the stream, and received from the Indians
Tonty's letter, which, they gravely said, was a "speaking
bark." As Iberville found no good place for a fort near
the mouth of the "Father of Waters," he built Bil-ox´i,
on the coast of what is now the state of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Shortly after, a party of Frenchmen, exploring the banks
of the river, saw an English ship sailing upstream. The
newcomers said they had come to build a fort on the
Mississippi; but the Frenchmen either deceived them by
telling them this was not the stream they sought, or gave
them to understand they had come too late. So the English
turned around and sailed away, and ever since that bend
in the great river has been called the "English Turn."</p>

<p>Iberville's brother, Bienville (be-a<span class="smcap">N</span>-veel´), in 1718 built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a fort and established a colony on the spot where New
Or´le-ans now stands. He gave the place that name in
honor of the French city of Orleans.</p>

<p>There was no more trouble with the English, but this
colony came very near being swept away by the Natch´ez
Indians, who made an agreement with the Choc´taws to
fall upon the white men on a certain day and hour, and
kill them all. To make sure that there should be no misunderstanding,
each chief was given a small bundle of
sticks, with directions to burn one every day, making the
attack only after the last had been consumed.</p>

<p>An Indian boy, seeing his father burn one of these sticks,
stole two, and secretly set fire to them; and though he
thus found out that they were nothing but ordinary wood,
his theft made his father attack the French two days too
soon.</p>

<p>Instead of a general raid upon all the settlements, only
one was surprised, two hundred men being killed, and the
women and children carried off into captivity. The other
French colonists had time to arm, and they defended themselves
so bravely that the plans of the Indians came to
naught.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XLIX. INDIANS ON THE WARPATH.</h2>


<p>The French were in possession of Acadia, New France,
and Louisiana. The immense tract of land drained
by the St. Lawrence and Mississippi rivers was rich in
fur-bearing animals, whose pelts were brought by Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and trappers to the missions and trading posts. There
they were loaded in canoes and floated down the Lakes
and the St. Lawrence, or down the Mississippi, so as to be
shipped to France from Quebec and New Orleans.</p>

<p>You might think that the French would have been satisfied
with all they had, but they were not. They longed
to control the Hudson also, which they claimed for France,
because they said Verrazano had first visited New York
Bay. Besides, Champlain had come within a few miles of
where Albany now stands, shortly before Hudson sailed
up the river bearing his name.</p>

<p>Longing for an excuse to drive the English away from
the Hudson valley, the French were glad when war was
declared, in 1689. Their king sent over Count Frontenac
to be governor of Canada again, and to lead in the struggle
with the English. Frontenac was a good general, and had
much influence over the Indians. He is said to have joined
in their war dances and athletic sports, in spite of his old
age, and to have boasted of the tortures he meant to inflict
on his English foes and their Iroquois allies.</p>

<p>But when Frontenac arrived in Canada (1689), he found
that the Iroquois had struck first. They had destroyed
some French villages, had killed many settlers, and had
even roasted and eaten some of their captives in sight of
Montreal. On the other hand, some Indian allies of the
French had surprised Dover, in New Hampshire. Here
dwelt Major Wal´dron, who had taken part in King
Philip's war. To avenge the capture of two hundred of
their race at that time, the savages now tortured Waldron
to death, cutting off his hand to see how much it weighed.
To their amazement, the scales marked just one pound!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
This awed them greatly, for although the traders had
always told them that a white man's hand exactly balanced
a pound of beaver skins, they had always doubted the
truth of that statement. Half the people in Dover were
killed, the rest carried off into captivity, and the town
reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>The next winter (1690), Frontenac sent a small band of
French and Indians against the village of Sche-nec´ta-dy,
New York, on snowshoes. They arrived there in the dead
of night. The place was defended by a high palisade, but
the inhabitants felt so sure no one would attack them that
cold night, that they had left both gates wide open, and
guarded only by huge snow sentinels set up there in fun.</p>

<p>Roused from sound slumbers by blood-curdling Indian
war whoops, a few escaped, but only to die of cold on their
way to Albany. Many of the rest were killed by the
attacking party, who, after burning the place to the ground,
withdrew with their captives and plunder.</p>

<p>In the course of this struggle,&mdash;which is known in our
history as "King William's War," because it took place
during that monarch's reign,&mdash;the French and Indians
attacked many villages in New York and New England.
The most daring of all their attempts was against Hā´ver-hill,
a town not very far from Boston. Here much property
was destroyed, and many people killed or captured.</p>

<p>There are countless stories told of the deeds of valor
done by men, women, and even little children in those
terrible times. You shall hear the story of Hannah Dustin,
of Haverhill, as an example. This poor woman was just
recovering from illness, and was alone in the house, with
her baby and nurse. Seven other children were out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
fields with their father, who was busy with his plow. All
at once, they were startled by a war whoop. Mr. Dustin,
seeing the Indians between him and his house, and knowing
he could not save his wife, bade the children run to
the blockhouse, while he bravely covered their retreat.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p186.jpg" width="450" height="358" alt="dustin" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Mr. Dustin defending his Children.</p></div>

<p>Father and children reached the fort in safety; but the
Indians rushed into the house, killed the baby by dashing
its head against the wall, and carried both women off as
captives. After several days' march and much ill treatment
Mrs. Dustin, her nurse, and two captive boys made
up their minds to escape. One of the boys had learned
from an Indian how to kill and scalp a foe; so one night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
when their captors were asleep, the four prisoners noiselessly
rose, seized tomahawks, and killed and scalped ten
Indians. Then they took a canoe, and with some trouble
made their way home. Mrs. Dustin received fifty pounds
reward for those scalps, besides a present from the governor
of Maryland, who admired her pluck. That people
might not forget what hard times the settlers had, her
statue has been placed in Concord, New Hampshire, where
you can see her grasping a tomahawk, ready to kill her foes.</p>

<p>As long as the war lasted, New Englanders and New
Yorkers defended themselves as bravely as they could.
But Indian foes were very hard to fight, because they
always fell upon people unawares. In their anger, the
colonists finally determined to carry the war into the
enemy's country. They therefore sent out a fleet under
Sir William Phips, to attack and destroy Port Royal, in
Acadia. This being done, the fleet tried to take Quebec,
while armies from New York and Connecticut attacked
Montreal. But both these attempts failed, and when the
war was ended by the treaty of Rys´wick (1697), neither
party had gained anything, although many lives had
been lost.</p>

<h2>L. TWO WARS WITH THE FRENCH.</h2>


<p>Both the French and the English suffered greatly
during King William's War, but the peace which followed
it did not last long. Five years later, "Queen Anne's
War" brought about new sufferings, and more deeds of
heroism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>We are told that, urged by a French priest, the Indians
built a church at St. Re´gis, in Canada. Wishing to have
a bell to hang in the tower of this chapel, each convert
brought a pelt, and the bell was ordered from France.
But on its way over, it fell, by accident, into the hands
of the English, who hung it up in the town of Deerfield,
in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The Indians, feeling that the bell belonged to them, and
egged on by their priest, made a sudden raid upon Deerfield,
in 1704, and, after killing or capturing many of the
people, rescued their bell from the English meetinghouse,
or church, and carried it off to St. Regis. They were so
delighted with it that it is said they rang it every step of
the way. This bell was cracked over a hundred years
later, and the Indians, who still prized it greatly, carried it
to Troy, where they had it refounded, while they mounted
guard over it day and night.</p>

<p>France and Spain were allies in this war, so the trouble
was not confined to New York and New England. The
Spaniards made a raid from St. Augustine, and vainly
attacked Charleston. A few years later, the New Englanders
conquered Acadia, and at the treaty of U´trecht, in
1713, the British received this province, Newfoundland,
and the land around Hudson Bay. But Acadia's name
was now changed to Nova Scotia, and Port Royal was
called Annapolis, in honor of the English queen.</p>

<p>For the next thirty years peace reigned unbroken; still,
during that time the French began to build their chain of
sixty forts along the Lakes, the Ohio, and the Mississippi,
thus drawing a line from the mouth of the St. Lawrence
to the mouth of the Mississippi. Most of these forts have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
since become cities, and you will find that many of them
still bear the French names given by their founders. Their
strongest fort, however, was at Lou´is-burg, on Cape Breton
Island. It was so well fortified that the French boasted
that even women could defend it against a large army.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">NORTH AMERICA<br />
BEFORE THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR</p></div>
</div>

<p>The third struggle with the French and Indians, which
began in 1744, is known in our country as "King
George's War," and in Europe as the "War of the Austrian
Succession."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Louisburg was so near Annapolis that the colonists
felt sure the French would set out from there to recover
Acadia. They therefore sent a messenger to England
to explain their danger and beg for troops to protect
them. But the prime minister knew so little about
America that the messenger had to show him Louisburg
and Annapolis on a map. He was so surprised then to
discover that Cape Breton is an island, that he ran off to
tell it to the king as a great piece of news.</p>

<p>Seeing that the British did not supply much help in
answer to their appeal, the colonists before long made up
their minds to take Louisburg themselves; and an army
of them bravely set out from New England, under the
leadership of Pep´per-ell, in 1745. After six weeks' siege,
and many deeds of daring, these four thousand New Englanders
took the fortress, and when the news reached
Boston the people almost went mad with joy. Three
years later, however, this joy was turned to equally deep
sorrow, for when the treaty of Aix-la-Cha-pelle´ (1748)
was signed, the fortress was given back to France, in exchange
for the town of Ma-dras´ in India.</p>

<p>Three wars had now been fought between the French
and the English, but the vexed question as to who should
own North America was not yet settled. The French had,
as you have seen, taken possession of the Mississippi valley;
but although some rumors of their presence there
had reached the colonies, very few people really knew
what the country was like, and what a vast tract of land
France could thus claim.</p>

<p>Many of the English colonies had received grants of
land running "from sea to sea," and now that population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
was increasing rapidly, people began to talk of crossing
the Alleghany Mountains to settle on the other side. They
were eager to do so, because hunters brought back to
Virginia glowing descriptions of the Ohio, or "Beautiful
River," the "Gateway of the West," and of the fertile lands
through which it flowed. Just at this time, the governor
of Virginia heard that the French were on the point of
building a fort on the Allegheny River, so he bade George
Washington, a young surveyor, find out if this news was
true, and carry a letter to the French officer there to
warn him that the Ohio country belonged to Virginia.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LI. WASHINGTON'S BOYHOOD.</h2>


<p>As you are going to hear a great deal about Washington,
it will interest you to learn something of his
family and his youth. Two Washington brothers came
over from England to Virginia about the year 1657, and
settled near the Potomac River. Augustine Washington,
the grandson of one of these men, married twice, and had,
in all, ten children. His eldest son by his second wife was
born on February 22, 1732, and named George. Shortly
after his birth, the family went to live on the Rap-pa-han´nock
River, and there George spent his early childhood.
He was a fearless, strong, hot-tempered little lad, but,
having good parents, was even then taught to control his
passions.</p>

<p>As he is the greatest man in our history, many stories,
true and untrue, are told about him. Perhaps the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
famous is about his new hatchet. We are told that Father
Washington planted young cherry trees in his garden. He
visited them daily to see how they throve, and was very
angry when he saw, one day, that a favorite tree was
badly hacked. On all Virginia plantations, there were
many negro children always running about. Thinking
one of these had done the mischief, Augustine Washington
was about to punish him, when his little son stopped
him, saying: "Father, I cannot tell a lie; I did it with my
little hatchet."</p>

<p>Washington was sent to a small school near by, and his
blank books, which can still be seen, show what a careful,
painstaking student he was. In one of these books he
copied a set of rules for good behavior, which he even then
tried to put into practice, and of which the last two were:
"Let your recreations be manful, not sinful," and "Labor
to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire
called conscience."</p>

<p>When Washington was only twelve, his father died,
leaving an estate to each of his sons. The care of the six
younger children and of their property was left to his wife,
a good and very sensible woman. She was very strict,
and brought up her children so carefully that they all
filled well their places in life. Indeed, her eldest son,
George, like most truly great men, often said that he
owed his mother more than words could ever tell.</p>

<p>Washington was always fond of all athletic exercises,
and as a lad delighted in riding the wildest horses on the
plantation. Among these was one young colt of such a
fiery temper that no one was allowed to mount him. One
day, the temptation to do so became too strong for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
George, and he suddenly sprang upon the horse's back.
The colt tried to throw him off, and, failing to do so,
dashed off at such a rate
that he burst a blood
vessel and fell down
dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p193.jpg" width="250" height="332" alt="colt" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Washington and the Colt.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Washington, dismayed
at the result of
his disobedience, went
silently home. At table,
his mother asked
her guests if they had
seen her beautiful
young horse. Covered
with blushes,&mdash;for he
was always modest and
reserved,&mdash;Washington
now confessed what he
had done. Although
Mrs. Washington keenly regretted the death of the colt,
she showed no anger, but quietly said: "It is well; but
while I regret the loss of my favorite, I rejoice in my son,
who always speaks the truth."</p>

<p>She was so fond of this son that when one of his half-brothers
wanted him to serve in the British navy, she refused
to let him go. As soon as Washington had finished
school, he went to live with this brother at Mount Vernon,
where he learned to know all the people around there, and,
among others, Lord Fair´fax.</p>

<p>This nobleman owned great tracts of land in the valleys
of the Alleghany Mountains, and as they had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
surveyed, he hired young George to do the work. This
was a very hard task, and the seventeen-year-old Washington
was often, for days at a time, far away from any
settlement, forced to depend upon hunting for food, and
obliged to sleep out in the open air.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus_p194.jpg" width="350" height="459" alt="bridge" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Virginia Natural Bridge.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These hardships, however, only made him strong and
self-reliant, and when he came back to his home, from
time to time, he doubly enjoyed the amusements of
the young people,
and danced
gayly, a pastime
of which he was
always fond. It
was probably
during one of
these surveying
expeditions that
Washington first
visited the Natural
Bridge in
Virginia. Here
he showed his
athletic skill by
tossing a coin on
top of it when
standing almost
directly under
it.</p>

<p>We are also told that he scaled the rocks, which were
then free from any except nature's marks, and reaching a
high point, carved his name in the stone. For years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Washington's name is said to have stood there on the
rocks, as far above all the rest as is his worth compared
with that of other men. But a young man once climbed up
there to carve his name above Washington's, an act of
presumption for which every one scorns him. He went
up so far that he could not come down again, but had to
climb higher and higher, and at last be drawn to the top
with a rope.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LII. WASHINGTON'S JOURNEY.</h2>


<p>By the time Washington was nineteen, he had shown
himself so capable, honest, and thoroughly trustworthy
that every one who knew him greatly respected
him. His brother Lawrence having fallen ill of consumption,
Washington went with him to Bar´ba-dos, where he
had an attack of smallpox.</p>

<p>This journey, the only one Washington ever made outside
the limits of our country, was so interesting to him
that he kept a diary in which he made note of all he saw
and heard. After a winter spent in the West Indies,
Washington came home to get his sister-in-law; but before
they could sail to join the invalid, they heard he was
coming home to die.</p>

<p>Washington tenderly nursed this older brother to the
end, and was made the guardian of his delicate little girl.
Lawrence Washington said that if his daughter died unmarried,
the estate of Mount Vernon was to belong to
George. In spite of all Washington's tender interest in
this little niece, and of the utmost care, she did not live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
long, and, as his brother had wished, Washington became
owner of Mount Vernon. There he began his favorite occupation
as a planter, and showed himself to be as careful and
painstaking a farmer as he was a surveyor.</p>

<p>We are told he packed his tobacco himself, and sent
such good flour to the West Indies that barrels marked
"George Washington" were always allowed to pass the
customhouse without being examined. Besides filling his
place as surveyor and planter, Washington also became
major in the Virginia militia, and took great interest in
all military affairs.</p>

<p>When the news of the Frenchmen's purpose to build
forts along the Allegheny and the Ohio reached Governor
Din-wid´die, he resolved, as we have seen, to send out a
trustworthy person to see if it was true, and to carry a
letter to the commander of the French force (1753). His
choice promptly fell upon Washington, who, receiving his
instructions, and perceiving the need of haste, started out
that same day to carry out the governor's orders.</p>

<p>He made his way across country to Logstown, where
he heard that the French commanding officer was on an
upper branch of the Allegheny River. He therefore went
thither, and delivered his letter. But the Frenchman
shrugged his shoulders, and said he would send the letter
on to Governor Duquesne (doo-kān´), whose orders he
was in the meantime bound to carry out. Tramping thus
through the wilderness in the dead of winter, Washington
found out all Governor Dinwiddie wished. Seeing he
must hasten, if the French were to be checked, the young
officer left his guides, baggage, and horses, and, alone with
Gist,&mdash;an experienced hunter and trapper,&mdash;went back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Virginia by a short cut. During this journey he and Gist
had several narrow escapes.</p>

<p>Once an Indian&mdash;who had probably been bribed by the
French to kill them&mdash;shot at them. Gist and Washington,
suspecting treachery, pretended it was only an accident;
but when the Indian left them at night, promising
to come back in the morning, they promptly broke camp.
Pressing forward all night, they reached the Allegheny
early in the morning, and found it only partly frozen. As
they could not cross on the ice, as they had hoped, they
plied their one dull hatchet with such a will that they soon
cut down several trees and built a rude raft.</p>

<p>But when they got out into the stream, Washington's
pole caught in the ice and jerked him out into ten feet of
ice-cold water. Grasping the raft, Washington escaped;
but his clothes were dripping wet, and a few moments
later they were frozen stiff. The raft was now driven on
an island, where Gist lighted a fire as quickly as possible;
and here Washington spent the night, turning around and
around so as to dry his clothes. Luckily, on the next
day the travelers found that the ice was strong enough to
bear them, and, crossing over to the other side of the
river, they hurried on.</p>

<p>After visiting an Indian queen, with whom he made
friends by giving her a few trinkets, Washington went on
to Virginia, where he gave Governor Dinwiddie all the
necessary information. The governor was so pleased with
what Washington had done, and thought his news so important,
that he published Washington's journal. Then,
to carry out the orders he had received from England, and
make sure the land south of the Ohio should not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
snatched away from him, Dinwiddie raised a force of two
hundred men, and sent them to build a fort at the forks of
the Ohio. While these men were busy erecting their stockade,
the French, one thousand strong, came down from
Ve-nan´go, on the Allegheny, and, driving the English
away, completed the fort for their own use, calling it
Duquesne, after their governor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LIII. WASHINGTON'S FIRST BATTLE.</h2>


<p>When the Virginians learned that the French had
driven their men away from the forks of the Ohio,
and had taken possession of the fort they had just begun,
they were naturally very angry. Seeing that they would
lose all claim to the land unless they drove the French
away, they now determined to raise enough men and
money to equip an army. Before long, therefore, Washington
was sent out with about three hundred men, and he
was busy erecting a small breastwork (called Fort Necessity)
at Great Meadows, when he heard that the French
were near there.</p>

<p>Setting out immediately, he surprised and defeated this
force; but learning that more troops were coming, he
prudently retreated to Fort Necessity, at Great Meadows,
which he once described as "a charming field for an
encounter." Here the French and Indians soon attacked
him in such numbers that, in spite of his valor, he was
forced to surrender, on July 4, 1754. Washington's men
had behaved so bravely that the French allowed them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
march out with the honors of war; that is, taking their
flag and their arms with them.</p>

<p>In describing this battle, Washington is reported to
have said: "I heard the bullets whistle, and believe me,
there is something charming in the sound." But later on,
when he had seen what a sad thing war really is, and
some one asked if he had ever said this, he quietly answered:
"If I said so, it was when I was young!"</p>

<p>When Washington and his troops came back to Virginia
after the battle at Great Meadows, the colonies saw that
the French were fully determined to leave them no land
west of the Alleghanies. They had felt so sure of this
that a few weeks before the battle they sent men to Albany
to discuss how they could best resist their enemies, and
keep what they claimed as their own.</p>

<p>Still, in one sense, neither French nor English had any
right to this land, for as a bewildered Indian chief remarked
when he first heard of the dispute: "If the French claim
all the land north of the river, and the English all the land
south of it, where is the land of the Indians?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LIV. STORIES OF FRANKLIN.</h2>


<p>One man was to have a great share in the last French
and Indian war, although he was no soldier. This
man was Franklin, and as he is one of the greatest men in
our history, it will surely interest you to hear a little
about him.</p>

<p>Born in a poor family in Boston, the lad was named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Benjamin, probably because he was his father's twelfth child.
With so many brothers and sisters older than himself,
Benjamin was not spoiled. As they were all very poor,
he was often obliged, small as he was, to help his father
make soap and dip tallow candles, a work he greatly disliked.
But as there had been free schools in New England
from the very beginning, Benjamin learned to read
out of the New England Primer when only a tiny boy.
He has told us many stories of himself; among others, one
of his childhood which you ought to know, because it
has given rise to an American proverb.</p>

<p>It seems that Benjamin once had a few pennies. This
was a great fortune for so small a lad, and although his
brothers and sisters teased him to know what he was
going to buy with them, he would not tell. On the street,
one day, he saw a big boy blowing a whistle with all his
might. This whistle so fascinated little Benjamin that,
after talking to its owner awhile, he gave all his pennies
in exchange for the toy.</p>

<p>Marching home, Benjamin proudly exhibited his treasure,
thinking he had made a great bargain and bought the
finest thing in the world. His disappointment was very
keen, therefore, when his brothers told him that it was only
a common whistle, such as he could have bought anywhere
for one penny! Ever since then, when any one
pays too much for pleasure, or anything else, people have
said: "He has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle."</p>

<p>As was the custom in all Puritan families, the Franklins
had long prayers, and they said such a lengthy grace before
meals that hungry little Benjamin often grew impatient.
As their breakfasts generally consisted of smoked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
dried herring, he once suggested that his father should say
grace over the whole barrel, so that he need not stop to
repeat it every time the fish was served!</p>

<p>Franklin's father was too poor to let him go on with
his studies, so at twelve Franklin became apprentice to
an older brother, the printer of the fourth newspaper
issued in our country. Here Franklin learned to set type
and to handle the rude press then in use. He also began
to write, and as he did not want his brother to know it, he
disguised his handwriting, and slipped his contributions
under the shop door at night.</p>

<p>These articles, written by a boy of fourteen, proved so
able that the brother read them aloud to his friends, who
greatly praised them, little suspecting that they were
written by the apprentice setting type in the corner.
But Benjamin's elder brother proved so unkind to him
that the boy left Boston at seventeen, and, embarking
upon a coasting vessel, went to New York, where he
vainly sought employment.</p>

<p>There he heard that work was to be had in Philadelphia,
then the largest city in our country. A stage ran
between that place and New York twice a week, making
the journey in two days. This rate of travel seemed so
very rapid then that this coach was generally called the
"Flying Machine." But as Franklin did not have the
means to pay for a seat in this conveyance, he embarked
on a sloop, working his way. After several days' tacking,
a long, weary tramp, and a row on the Delaware, he landed
in Philadelphia early one morning.</p>

<p>By this time he had only a few pennies left, which,
as he felt hungry, he soon gave to a baker for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
large rolls. The small amount of luggage he had with
him was thrust into his coat pockets, and with a roll under
either arm, and one in his hand, Franklin strolled down
the street, munching his bread as he walked along. A
girl standing on her father's doorstep laughed at the awkward
lad passing by, little thinking that a few years
later she would be his wife.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p202.jpg" width="450" height="367" alt="entry" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Franklin's Entry into Philadelphia.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Finding employment in Philadelphia, Franklin worked
hard, studying as much as he could after hours. Every
book he could buy or borrow was eagerly read, and he
paid small sums to booksellers for the loan of their volumes
overnight, sitting up late and rising early so as to get all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
he could out of them. Franklin loved books so dearly
that he soon learned a great deal about foreign countries.
He longed to visit them, and therefore gladly welcomed a
proposal to go to England and buy a printing press.</p>

<p>As the governor of Pennsylvania promised to supply
the necessary funds, Franklin set out; but upon landing in
England he found that the governor had deceived him,
and that there was no money to be had. Alone in a
foreign land, without means or friends, Franklin again
sought employment, and worked for an English printer
during the next few years. By dint of hard work and
great economy, he managed to save money enough to bring
him back to Philadelphia, at the age of twenty. Then,
after working as clerk and printer for a while, Franklin
set up in business for himself, and married.</p>

<p>Besides printing a newspaper,&mdash;for which he wrote the
articles, set the type, handled the press, and even carted
the paper to his shop in a wheelbarrow,&mdash;Franklin soon
began to publish a pamphlet called "Poor Richard's
Almanac." It contained not only the usual information
about sunrise and sunset, the moon, tide, and weather, but
many short sayings, full of good advice. They were so
easily remembered, and so often quoted, that some of them
have become household sayings. A few are: "No
gains without pains." "Never leave that till to-morrow
which you can do to-day." "Time is money." "Keep
conscience clear, then never fear."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/illus_p204.jpg" width="349" height="650" alt="almanac" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Page from Poor Richard's Almanac.</p></div>
</div>

<p>You might think that Franklin was busy enough with
all this work; still, he managed to learn a great deal
besides French, German, Spanish, and Italian, which he
studied alone and at night. He founded the first public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a><br /><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
library in Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania, and
the first fire brigade, the first insurance company, and the
first hospital in the city. Besides that, he invented the
first good stove, advised paving the streets, and was constantly
in political office from the time he was thirty until
he died, at the age of eighty-four.</p>

<p>Franklin was so interested in sciences that he studied
them closely, too; and in 1752, after thinking the matter
over a long while, he decided that lightning must be the
same thing as the electricity produced by rubbing a cat's
fur. He therefore determined to bring lightning down from
the clouds, to find out whether he was right. After many
experiments, he built a kite, fastened a sharp point to it,
and flew it one stormy day. He had taken all his measures
so carefully that he thus really drew down some electric
sparks from the sky.</p>

<p>As Franklin was a very practical man, he immediately
made use of this knowledge to invent lightning rods for
protecting churches and houses from thunderbolts. His
discovery, ridiculed at first, soon became known abroad,
and thus Franklin was the first American who won a
European reputation.</p>

<p>Franklin's kite-flying paved the way for all the wonderful
discoveries since made in electricity, many of which
he then foretold, although people thought he was only
joking. Indeed, we are told he even demonstrated the
deadly effect of a live wire by killing a turkey on the other
side of the river! When his discoveries became known
in Europe, they created a great sensation, and the "Franklin
experiments" were for a while all the fashion.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>




<h2>LV. BRADDOCK'S DEFEAT.</h2>


<p>In 1754, Franklin, deputy postmaster-general of the
colonies, was sent to Albany, where, as we have already
seen, a congress of delegates from the colonies met to
discuss the best way of opposing the French. Franklin,
knowing that it was only by working all together that the
best results could be reached, now made a plan for the
union of the colonies.</p>

<p>As one can often make people understand things better
by telling them stories or showing them pictures, Franklin
remembered the common belief that a snake, cut into pieces,
would become whole again if the parts were allowed to
touch. He therefore placed at the head of his paper the
picture of such a snake, cut into pieces to represent the
colonies, which he further indicated by their initials. Under
this picture he wrote the motto: "Join or die."</p>

<p>Although the colonies did not adopt Franklin's plan
of union, they nevertheless voted men and money for the
war. The British, on their part, sent over General Braddock,
one of their best officers, to take charge of the campaign.
Meeting the governors of the different colonies in
Virginia, Braddock decided that, while one army marched
north from Albany to take Forts Ti-con-der-o´ga and
Crown Point before going on to Quebec, a second should
move westward from the same point to Lake On-tā´ri-o
and Niagara.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a fleet was to sail from New England
to join the first army in besieging Quebec. But the fourth
and principal expedition, led by Braddock himself, was to
march across Pennsylvania to Fort Duquesne, so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
drive the French out of the coveted Ohio valley. This
plan was very fine; but Braddock, used to the European
way of fighting, little knew how to carry on war with the
French and Indians in the pathless forests.</p>

<p>Washington now advised Braddock, his superior officer,
to leave the heavy baggage and cannons behind; but the
British general would not consent. After much delay,
the Pennsylvania farmers loaned their wagons and horses
to carry the baggage, thanks to Franklin's personal efforts,
and the army set out. But as Braddock insisted upon
the army's marching along
in an orderly file, a road
had first to be built, and
Washington once impatiently
said that they stopped "to
level every molehill."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p207.jpg" width="450" height="373" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">At Braddock's Defeat.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Washington knew it would
be best to advance rapidly and surprise Fort Duquesne;
but the army moved slowly until, at about eight miles from
the fort, it was suddenly attacked by the French and Indians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The British soldiers, clad in red and marching in
close ranks, made fine targets for their enemies, who, as
usual, hid behind every tree and rock, whence they poured
a deadly fire upon them. Braddock bravely rallied his
men again and again; but not knowing how to fight
unseen foes, they were helplessly slain. The general himself,
after seeing great numbers of his men and officers fall,
was mortally wounded, and had to order a retreat.</p>

<p>In the midst of this horrible scene, Washington and his
Virginian soldiers alone kept cool. Four bullets passed
through Washington's coat, and two horses were killed
under him, for the Indians aimed specially at him. But
all their bullets failed, and they afterwards said with awe
that he surely bore a charmed life, and that no shot could
ever touch him.</p>

<p>Nearly all the officers were killed, but Washington managed
to cover the retreat of the British, and their wounded
general was picked up and borne off the battlefield of the
Mo-non-ga-he´la. Braddock was now full of remorse for not
following Washington's advice, and he died four days
later, saying: "Who would have thought it? Who would
have thought it? We shall better know how to deal with
them another time."</p>

<p>Washington sadly buried the brave general in the
Pennsylvania woods, making the army march over his
grave, so that no trace of upturned soil should betray to
the Indians his last resting place. Then the beaten
and disheartened troops slowly made their way back,
encouraged by Washington, who, going afoot, shared all
their hardships, and relieved the weary men by loading
their muskets and baggage upon his own horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The army marching westward from Albany had, in the
meantime, paused discouraged at Os-we´go, while the one
moving northward beat the French on the shores of a
lake, which they called George, in honor of the victory
won for their king (1755). The French officer Dieskau
(dees´kow) was captured there, and among the English
dead was Ephraim Williams, who left his fortune to found
the college in Massachusetts which bears his name.</p>

<p>Fearing that the Acadian farmers, who still spoke French
and loved their mother country, would turn against them,
the British now tried to make the peasants take an oath of
fidelity. When they refused, the men and boys were bidden
to assemble, and then, after some delay, they and their
families were sent on board British ships and taken away
(1755). In the confusion several families were separated.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Expulsion of the Acadians.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus ruthlessly torn from home, the Acadians were
scattered throughout the colonies. Many made their way
to Louisiana, so as to be still under French rule; others escaped
into the
woods; and a
few spent long
years vainly
seeking those
they loved.

<h2>LVI. WOLFE AT QUEBEC.</h2>


<p>Until 1756, the war between the French and the
British raged only in America; but after that it
broke out in Europe also, where it was known as the
"Seven Years' War."</p>

<p>The French sent over Mont-calm´, one of their best
generals, who, helped by the Indians, soon took and
burned Oswego. Next, he captured Fort William Henry,
which the Americans had just built; but he promised that
the garrison should leave under safe escort (1757). His
Indian allies, however, loath to see the foe depart unharmed,
suddenly attacked them, and killed many. Montcalm
bravely and vainly tried to stop this, crying: "Kill me,
but spare the English who are under my protection."</p>

<p>This year of 1757 was, on the whole, a disastrous one
for the British; but during the next, the tables were turned.
The principal statesman in England was then William
Pitt, a good friend to the American colonies. Knowing
that, unless prompt measures were taken, the British would
lose the main part of their possessions in America, Pitt
sent over men with great stores of arms and money.</p>

<p>The British and American troops, properly equipped,
now started out again to carry out Braddock's plan. This
time, Forbes was in command, ably assisted by Washington,
and they forced the French to abandon Fort Duquesne.
Near its ruins the British built a stockade which was
named Pittsburg, in honor of William Pitt.</p>

<p>Upon returning to Virginia after this triumph, Washington,
who had lately married a widow with two children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
quietly took his seat in the House of Burgesses. To his
dismay, the Speaker praised him for all he had done for his
country. Embarrassed by this speech, Washington arose
and vainly tried to make the proper response, until the
Speaker, seeing his predicament, kindly said: "Sit down,
Mr. Washington; your modesty equals your valor, and that
surpasses the power of any language I possess."</p>

<p>A few months before the seizure of Fort Duquesne, the
British captured the fortress of Louisburg for the second
time, and Fort Frontenac was destroyed. Thus, step by
step, the French were driven into Canada, where James
Wolfe, a brave young British officer, was ordered to take
Quebec. Now, Quebec is built upon a high rock, and it
was impossible to reach its citadel from three sides. But
Wolfe, thinking that it could be attacked from the Plains
of A´bra-ham, went up the river past the city, and then,
one night, drifted noiselessly downstream toward the place
where he wished to land.</p>

<p>Wolfe was a charming young man, loving art and poetry,
and as he went down the St. Lawrence, he mentioned a
poem of Gray's, saying: "I would rather be the author of
the 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard' than have
the glory of beating the French to-morrow." Then he
repeated the following lines with deep feeling:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Await alike the inevitable hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The paths of glory lead but to the grave."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the brave young man seemed to foresee, the path
of glory was to lead him also to the grave. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
minutes later, his boats came within range of the French
sentinels, and their challenge was answered in such good
French that they let the boats pass. After landing, Wolfe
climbed up the steep path, and had his army all drawn up
for battle on the Plains of Abraham the next morning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p212.jpg" width="450" height="371" alt="battle" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Battle of Quebec.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Montcalm, taken thus unawares, led out
his troops and fought bravely; but he was defeated
by Wolfe, who, as well as Montcalm, was mortally
wounded in the fray. The French commander breathed
his last a few hours later, saying: "Thank God, I shall not
live to see Quebec surrender!"</p>

<p>His equally brave young enemy, dying on the battlefield,
heard his men cry: "They run! they run!" Breathlessly
he inquired, "Who run?" but when he heard that
it was the French, he fell back, saying: "Now God be
praised! I can die in peace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>This memorable battle, fought in 1759, is commemorated
by a monument on the Plains of Abraham, on
which the names of both generals are carved. There is
also a famous monument in West´min-ster Abbey, in
honor of Wolfe, the conqueror
of Quebec.</p>

<p>The fall of Quebec decided
the fate of the French in America.
They had already lost the
Ohio valley, Forts Ticonderoga
and Crown Point, and soon after,
Montreal surrendered too.</p>

<p>Although the last French and
Indian War was now over in America,
the war between France and
England continued until 1763,
when it was ended by the treaty
of Păr´is. Because more land
changed hands on this occasion
than ever before, the treaty of
Paris is known in history as the
biggest land deal ever made. To Great Britain France
gave up Canada and her claims to all the land east of the
Mississippi, except New Orleans. For herself she kept
only two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on
which to dry fish. Spain, siding with France in this war,
received from her ally all of Louisiana west of the Mississippi,
and the city of New Orleans. To recover
Havana, which had been taken by a British fleet, Spain
gave up Florida, which had belonged to her ever since
Ponce de Leon first visited it in 1512.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 200px;">

Abbey.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>All these changes did not please everybody, and the
Indians so disliked the English rule that, led by Pon´ti-ac,
one of their chiefs, they began a war which bears his
name (1763). In the course of this struggle seven forts
were taken, and many settlers cruelly slain.</p>

<p>The garrison at De-troit´, however, having been warned
that the Indians were planning a surprise, showed so
brave a front that Pontiac failed to get possession of that
place. But some of his allies had better luck at Michilimackinac.
They assembled near there as if to play a
game, and tossing their ball nearer and nearer the palisade,
finally made a wild dash through the open gates. The
garrison was butchered, and only one trader managed to
escape. Then, after continuing this war some time longer,
the Indians were forced to submit, and three years later,
Pontiac, the leader of the revolt, was shot by an Indian
who had been bribed to kill him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LVII. HOW ENGLAND TREATED HER
COLONIES.</h2>


<p>The people in England had seemed to think all along
that the colonies in America ought to do all they
could to enrich England. Their idea was that the mother
country had a right to the earnings of the colonies,
so they treated the colonists like little children, not old
enough to think or work for themselves.</p>

<p>Among other things, the English made laws about trade
and navigation which were very good for England, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
very bad for the colonies. For instance, they said that
the Americans should not sell their tobacco, rice, sugar,
furs, etc., to any country except England. Any colonist
having any of these things for sale had to put them on
English ships, and pay freight to carry them to England.
Then he had to pay duty before his produce could be sold.
Some other articles could be sold to other countries, provided
they were sent over in English ships. But no vessels
from foreign countries were allowed to come into any
of the American ports, either to buy or to sell; and if a
colonist wanted something from France, he had to get it by
way of England,
although it cost
him much more.</p>

<p>As if all this
were not bad
enough, the English
were so anxious
to sell the
goods they manufactured,
that
they said the
Americans must
buy of them, instead
of making
such articles for
sale. Thus, a farmer
could hammer out rough tools for his own use from
the iron dug up on his land, but he could not make even a
hoe for his neighbors in any other colony.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus_p215.jpg" width="350" height="347" alt="spinning" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Spinning.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The women, who spun and wove their own flax and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
wool, cut and made ordinary family garments, and plaited
straw, which they sewed together for hats, could not even
sell a pair of mittens in the next colony. If the New
Englanders wanted to exchange codfish for Virginia
tobacco, they either had to send it by way of England,
thus paying for its being carried twice across the Atlantic,
or else they were obliged to pay heavy duties.</p>

<p>In her fear that the colonies would sell to other countries
anything she could use, England even forbade Americans
to cut down any very large or straight trees without her
permission. She said that all this timber should be kept
until she needed it as masts for her vessels.</p>

<p>Of course, the colonies did not like this, but they bore
it for a long time as patiently as they could. Other
countries did not approve of England's trade and navigation
laws, either. Both the French and the Dutch, for
instance, wanted to trade with the colonies. As the coast
was very long, and there were customhouse officers in
only a few of the towns, some foreign vessels managed to
slip into small bays unseen, and thus began smuggling
goods in and out of the country.</p>

<p>As long as France owned Canada, smuggling could not
very well be stopped, for French or Dutch vessels caught
along the coast said that they were on their way to or
from Canada, and that they had been driven out of their
course by contrary winds. But when the last French and
Indian War was over, foreign vessels no longer had any
excuse for coming near North America. The British,
therefore, declared they would now seize any foreign vessel
they met, and search any house where they fancied
smuggled goods could be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Orders to search houses were called search warrants.
They gave government officers the right to go over every
part of a dwelling, and look into every closet and drawer.
But people like to feel that their houses are their own, and
that no one can come in unless invited. Knowing that
those search warrants would make it easy for any officer
who happened to dislike them to annoy them constantly,
the Americans naturally objected to them.</p>

<p>The man who first spoke publicly against these search
warrants, in the old statehouse in Boston, was James O´tis.
When he declared that this was not right, he was told it
was done in Great Britain as well as in America. Otis
then answered that, as the British had a share in making
that law, they were, of course, obliged to obey it. But he
added that the Americans had no seats in the British Par´lia-ment,
had had no share in making the law, and were
therefore not bound to respect it.</p>

<p>Many of the colonists agreed with Otis, so the British
officers did not dare offend them by making frequent visits
to their houses; but they kept ships along the coast to
chase all suspicious vessels and see whether they had any
foreign goods on board. This proceeding was almost as
disagreeable to the colonists as searching their houses.</p>

<p>One of these boats, the <i>Gas´pee</i>, in pursuing a colonial
vessel, ran ashore in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, in
1772. Before it could be worked off the shoal,&mdash;which is
still known as Gaspee Point,&mdash;a number of the best citizens
of Providence came in disguise and set fire to the ship.
But although the British said their flag had been insulted,
and tried to find the guilty parties, they never could lay
hands upon them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>




<h2>LVIII. THE STAMP TAX.</h2>


<p>Besides the galling trade and navigation laws to which
the poor American colonists had to submit, there
were other troubles which you must try to understand.
The French and Indian War had cost a great deal of
money, which had to be paid. It was also needful to take
steps to arrange for the government of the new territory,
and especially to defend it, for the British knew that the
French and Spaniards would like to get it back.</p>

<p>Now, King William's War, Queen Anne's War, and King
George's War had been waged because England and
France were fighting in Europe. They had done no good
to the colonists, who, even after furnishing men and money,
and winning Louisburg, saw it given back to the French.
It was different, though, with the fourth war, which was
begun in America, while Great Britain furnished men,
money, and arms to defend the colonies. The colonies
had done their best to help, and the American soldiers,
whom the British mockingly called "Yankee Doodles,"
had shown great courage.</p>

<p>Franklin tried to arrange matters of taxation by his plan
of government, which, you remember, was set aside at
Albany (1754). The colonies refused it because they said
it gave too much power to the king; and the king refused
to accept it because it gave too much power to the colonies.</p>

<p>King George's advisers now told him that as Great
Britain had run into debt fighting in America, it was only
right that the colonies should help to pay the money.
They added that it would be necessary to keep an army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in America to defend the new-won lands, and that the
colonies ought to feed and pay these soldiers.</p>

<p>If Great Britain had asked the colonies, "Will you support
an army?" they might perhaps have consented. But
instead of letting the Americans talk the matter over and
raise the money in any way they pleased, measures were
taken by Parliament to raise a large sum, which the king
was to use in providing for a standing army.</p>

<p>At that time, many of the British were dissatisfied, too,
for the members of the House of Commons no longer
represented the whole nation. New cities like Bir´ming-ham,
Man´ches-ter, and Leeds had no right to vote at all,
while a few tumble-down places, which had been towns
two hundred years before, still sent several members to
Parliament. Pitt and some other statesmen said that a
new census ought to be taken, and that the House of
Commons should represent all the people of Great Britain;
but the king, among others, thought things ought to
remain just as they were.</p>

<p>The two parties were still quarreling over this when
the question about America came up, and it was greatly
because the British were not fairly represented that unjust
laws were made. To raise the money, Parliament decreed
that the colonies would have to keep the trade and navigation
laws, and pay a tax upon sugar and molasses, and
that no newspaper should be printed or deed written except
on paper stamped by government officers. This was called
the "Stamp Act."</p>

<p>As soon as Pitt heard that the Stamp Act had been
passed, he said it was wrong to tax the colonies without
their consent. But Parliament would not listen to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
In those days, vessels crossed the Atlantic only once a
month. There was no telegraph, no daily newspapers,
and the post between large cities like Philadelphia and
New York ran only twice or thrice a week. It therefore
took some time before the news of the passing of the
Stamp Act became generally known in America.</p>

<p>Franklin, who was then in England, did his best to
hinder the making of such an unjust law. He was once
asked whether the Americans would be angry; and, hoping
to make the British understand how unreasonable they
were, he told them this story: A Frenchman once came
running out of his house with a red-hot poker. He
grasped an Englishman, passing by, and said: "Let me run
this poker through you!" Of course the Englishman
declined. Then the Frenchman said: "Well, let me at
least run it a few inches into your body." But when the
Englishman again refused, the Frenchman said, in an aggrieved
way: "If you won't let me do either, you should
at least pay for the trouble of heating this poker!"</p>

<p>Still, all Franklin's tact and good sense could not prevent
the law being passed, and he sadly wrote home: "The
sun of liberty is set; the Americans must light the lamp
of industry and economy."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LIX. THE ANGER OF THE COLONIES.</h2>


<p>Most Americans were not ready to take things
so quietly as Franklin. Indeed, as soon as the news
of the Stamp Act became known, there was great excitement.
Bells were tolled, and every one looked sad. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Virginia, Patrick Henry arose in the House of Burgesses,
and made a fiery speech which convinced the people that it
would be wrong and cowardly to yield. In his speech he
said that tyranny must be resisted, and added: "Cæsar
had his Brutus, Charles I. his Cromwell, and George
III.&mdash;" "Treason! Treason!" cried some of the members
who were friends of the king. But Patrick Henry
went firmly on, "may profit by their example. If this be
treason, make the most of it!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p221.jpg" width="450" height="352" alt="speech" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Patrick Henry's Speech.</p></div>
</div>

<p>His speech fairly carried the people away, and when he
concluded it by saying: "Give me liberty, or give me
death," the Virginians drew up a set of resolutions saying
that they had the same rights as the people in Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Britain, that they could be taxed only by their assemblies,
and that they would not allow any one else to tax them.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, John Ashe said: "This law will be
resisted in blood and death." This opinion was so general
that Massachusetts suggested that a general "Stamp Act
Congress" should be held in New York, in 1765. All but
four colonies were represented in it, and six of them drew
up a paper saying that as British subjects they could be
taxed only by their own consent, and that as they had no
members in Parliament, they would not obey that body.</p>

<p>This paper was called the "Declaration of Rights," and
they added to it another, saying that there were five things
they had to complain about. These were: being taxed
without their consent, being tried in some cases without a
jury, being hampered in their trading, and being asked to
pay the sugar tax and the stamp tax.</p>

<p>Men everywhere began thinking how they could keep
their rights, and formed companies called "Sons of Liberty."
These bands visited the men chosen to sell the
stamped paper, and sternly warned them not to try to do
so unless they wished to be treated like traitors. The result
was that, so far as is now known, not a single sheet of
stamped paper was ever sold in America. Indeed, when
the day came when they were to have been first used, a
Pennsylvania newspaper appeared with the heading, "No
stamped paper to be had."</p>

<p>The excitement was such that even the children marched
up and down like their elders, crying, "Liberty, Property,
and No Stamps!" or even such hard words as "Taxation
without representation is tyranny."</p>

<p>As we have already seen, there were many people in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Great Britain who thought the Stamp Act unjust. Two
great men, Burke and Pitt, openly said so; and when the
news came that the Americans refused to obey, the latter
exclaimed: "I rejoice that America has resisted. Three
millions of people so dead to all the feelings of liberty as
voluntarily to submit to be slaves, would have been fit
instruments to make slaves of all the rest."</p>

<p>The British minister, Gren´ville, now sent for Franklin,
and asked whether he thought the Americans would pay
the stamp tax if it were less. But Franklin said: "No;
never! They will never submit to it;" and went on to
explain that it was not a question of more or less money,
but a question of right and wrong.</p>

<p>As the Americans declared they would not buy a single
thing from the British until their rights were respected,
British vessels soon went home with unsold cargoes, and
British merchants loudly cried that their business was
ruined. These complaints, added to the colonists' determined
resistance, made Parliament repeal, or call back, the
Stamp Act, six months after it was to be enforced.</p>

<p>The stamps which were never used were stored away
in a room in the House of Parliament. Here they lay
forgotten for many a year, and when they were finally unearthed
again, they were either given away as curiosities
or destroyed.</p>

<p>The news of the repeal of the Stamp Act set the
Americans almost crazy with joy. Bells were rung, bonfires
lighted, and speeches made. In New York the people
were so happy that they erected a new liberty pole,
and made a big leaden statue of King George, which they
set up on Bowling Green.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>




<h2>LX. THE BOSTON TEA PARTY.</h2>


<p>In their joy the colonists did not at first notice that Parliament,
in repealing the Stamp Act, still claimed the
right to tax the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." But
the very next year Parliament passed what are known in
history as the "Townshend Acts," from the man who
proposed them. These laws, besides forcing the colonists
to feed the king's troops and keep the trade law, placed a
tax on glass, paint, tea, and a few other things.</p>

<p>The money raised by these taxes was to be used partly
for paying the salaries of governors, judges, customhouse
and other colonial officers. Hitherto, the colonies had paid
the salaries of governors and judges themselves, and they
said that, while it might be all right to let a good king be
paymaster, a bad king might make them very uncomfortable
by sending out governors like Andros and Berkeley,
who, being paid by him, would care only to please him.</p>

<p>Urged on by the Massachusetts people, all the colonies
wrote to Great Britain that they would not buy any British
goods until the taxes were removed. The king, offended
by the letters sent him, ordered the governors to dissolve
the colonial assemblies again and again; but he could not
prevent the Americans from talking and thinking as they
pleased. When his troops began to come, men, women,
and children scowled at them, openly calling them "lobsters"
and "bloody-backs" because they wore red coats.</p>

<p>As the Massachusetts people talked loudest, and urged
the other colonies to resist, King George sent General
Gage to Boston with two regiments. They came into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
city on Sunday morning, with flags flying and drums beating,
a thing which greatly shocked the good Puritans.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p225.jpg" width="450" height="276" alt="boston" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The "Boston Massacre".</p></div>
</div>

<p>The presence of British soldiers in America greatly annoyed
the people. They daily grew more and more
angry about it, and before long a small fight took place
between soldiers and citizens, at Golden Hill, in the city
of New York. Two months later, in the midst of the
excitement caused by a false alarm of fire in Boston, a
British soldier, annoyed by the taunts and snowballs of a
mob, shot a man. This became the signal for more firing,
which killed five men and wounded a few others (1770).</p>

<p>The excitement caused in the city by the "Boston
Massacre," or the "Bloody Massacre," as it is known, in
history, proved very great. Although the principal men
in Boston knew the soldiers had not been greatly to blame
for what had happened, they saw that there would be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
trouble unless the troops left the town. Samuel Ad´ams,
therefore, explained this to the governor, who asked him
if the people would be satisfied if he sent one regiment
away. Adams answered that he would find out, but,
going to the Old South Meetinghouse, where the patriots
were assembled, he passed up the aisle, whispering to his
friends right and left: "Both regiments or none."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus_p226.jpg" width="350" height="294" alt="hall" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Faneuil Hall.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When Adams reached the platform, and told the people
what the governor had said, his friends loudly cried: "Both
regiments or none!" The rest of the people shouted the
same thing. So the governor, much against his will, was
forced to place the soldiers on an island in the
bay. But after that, when mentioning those
troops, King George spitefully called them
"Sam Adams's
regiments."</p>

<p>The removal
of the soldiers
quieted the Boston
people a
little; still, they
often met in
Faneuil (fan´el)
Hall, where such
stirring patriotic
speeches were made that the building is often called
the "Cradle of Liberty."</p>

<p>The people had said they would not buy anything
from Great Britain until the taxes were removed; so, when
tea ships came over, their cargoes were either sent back,
stored in damp cellars, or destroyed. The British merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
complained about this, and the king himself, who
was interested in the tea company, soon found he was
losing money, too. He therefore proposed that the price
of tea should be reduced, so that even after the tax of
threepence a pound was paid, tea would be cheaper than
ever before. But this made no difference to the colonists.
The question with them was not cheap tea, but untaxed tea.</p>

<p>To prevent any one from buying any of this tea, all the
ports were carefully watched; but finally three ships
entered Boston harbor with strict orders to land their
cargoes. As the governor would not send the ships back,
and insisted that the king's orders should be carried out,
Samuel Adams finally said, in a large assembly: "This
meeting can do nothing more to save the country."</p>

<p>This was evidently a secret signal, for a voice immediately
asked in an innocent way: "Will tea mix with sea
water?" In reply some one shouted: "Boston harbor
for a teapot to-night! Hurrah for Griffin's wharf!" The
crowd now poured out of the Old South, and on reaching
the street saw a band of men, disguised as Indians,
rushing toward the pier. These make-believe Indians
took possession of the dock, boarded the three ships,
broke open the tea chests with their tomahawks, and
poured their contents into the harbor, which thus became
a monster teapot at Boston's famous Tea Party.</p>

<p>The Indians were careful, however, not to touch anything
else, and when their work was done, they quickly
vanished. Still, they were so honest that a padlock,
broken by mistake, was secretly replaced by a new one
on the next day. It is said that the tide the next
morning left heaps of damp tea leaves on the beach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Some was put in bottles and kept, in memory of Boston's
Tea Party; but the rest of it was either thrown back into
the water or burned, so that no one should be tempted to
touch it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXI. THE MINUTEMEN.</h2>


<p>Upon hearing the news of the Boston Tea Party
Parliament made five harsh laws to punish the Bostonians.
These were that no ships should be allowed to
come in or go out of their port until they had paid for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the tea; that the governor could send any one he pleased
to England for trial; that the charter of Massachusetts
was to be taken away; that the colonists should receive
and feed the troops; and that the province of Quebec
should be extended to the Ohio, thus including the western
lands claimed by Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The Bostonians said they could not, and would not,
stand these five laws, which they called the "five intolerable
acts." The other colonies declared that the Bostonians
were right, and promised to help them resist; so
it was decided that delegates from all the colonies should
meet at Philadelphia, in 1774, to act together.</p>

<p>All the colonies except Georgia sent delegates to this
First Continental Congress. They met in Carpenter's Hall,
in Philadelphia, and decided to print and circulate papers
explaining to the colonies, to the Canadians, and to the
British people their causes of complaint. They also drew
up a declaration of rights and an address to the king.</p>

<p>Samuel Adams, who is often called the "Father of the
Revolution," wrote this petition to the king; and his young
daughter, seeing the paper, cried: "Only think of it; that
paper will soon be in the king's hand!" But her father
dryly answered: "My dear, it will more likely be spurned
by the royal foot!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">PART OF THE NORTHERN STATES<br />
COUNTRY AROUND BOSTON</p></div>
</div>

<p>There were many noted men among the fifty-five
members of the First Continental Congress. Franklin
had come home to take part in it, after having patiently
tried to make peace with the Englishmen, who insulted
him. While Congress was in session, some one asked Patrick
Henry who was the leading man there, and he answered:
"If you speak of eloquence, Mr. Rut´ledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a><br /><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
South Carolina is by far the greatest orator; but if you
speak of solid information, Colonel Washington is unquestionably
the greatest man on the floor!"</p>

<p>Before separating, this congress decided that another
should assemble the next year to hear King George's answer
to their petition, and to discuss what steps should
next be taken. But although Congress was dismissed,
the colonies, in spite of the bad postal arrangements of
the age, kept up a lively correspondence.</p>

<p>Patrick Henry, on his return home, told the Virginia
convention what had been done, and concluded an eloquent
speech by saying: "We must fight! I repeat it, sir,
we must fight! An appeal to arms and the God of hosts
is all that is left us." And in South Carolina the patriots
loudly echoed the sentiments of their delegate, showing
that "three million brave Americans, scattered over three
thousand miles, had but one soul."</p>

<p>This was the opinion of patriots everywhere, and, feeling
that they might soon be called upon to maintain their
rights, they formed companies and drilled regularly. One
of these bands of militia was formed in Virginia, where
Washington said: "I shall very cheerfully accept the
honor of commanding it, if occasion requires it to be
drawn out." In New England many similar regiments
were drilled, and as these volunteer soldiers were to be
ready to start at a moment's notice, they were known as
"minutemen."</p>

<p>The women were quite as patriotic as the men. They
gave up tea and all other imported goods, and began to
spin and weave with such energy that they and their families
soon wore nothing but homespun. Even at a ball, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Virginia, the ladies wore rough cloth of their own manufacture,
rather than purchase cloth, silk, and lace from England.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Statue of Minuteman.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As Boston suffered most of all, the other colonies
showed their sympathy by sending all the supplies they
could by land. Indeed,
neighboring places, such as
Mar-ble-head´ and Salem,
even offered to let Boston
merchants use their port
free of charge.</p>

<p>Instead of answering the
"olive branch" petition
sent by the colonies, King
George told General Gage,
governor of Massachusetts,
to bring the people to order
as soon as possible. But
Gage soon saw that the
colonists were too angry
to yield tamely, and all he
dared do was to stop their
meetings and to fortify Boston
Neck.</p>

<p>But meetings were held
in spite of him, for the principal
Bostonians went to Cambridge, where they formed a
Committee of Safety. This was to watch the movements
of the British, collect arms and ammunition, and see that
the minutemen were always ready for duty. For every
one now felt that the fight must soon break out, although
neither party wished to begin it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>




<h2>LXII. THE BATTLE OF LEXINGTON.</h2>


<p>General Gage knew that the patriots were collecting
supplies, and he was determined to seize
them if he could. But there were good patriots in Boston
who were watching him closely, and they had agreed to
warn their friends of any danger, by means of lanterns
hung up in the tower of the Old North Church.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p233.jpg" width="450" height="342" alt="revere" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Paul Revere's Ride.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two lights in the tower, one night, notified the people of
Charlestown that the British were moving, and the minutemen
on guard scattered to rouse their fellow-soldiers.
Paul Re-vere´, among others, dashed off on horseback, narrowly
escaping capture by the British, who were guarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
all the roads. As he galloped rapidly on, he roused the
people by crying: "The British are coming!" Finally he
reached Lex´ing-ton, about nine miles from Boston. Here
Samuel Adams and John Hancock had both taken refuge,
because Gage wanted to seize and ship them off to England,
to be tried there for treason.</p>

<p>The clatter made by Revere roused the sleeping patriots,
and when one of them asked what all this noise meant,
Revere quickly answered: "Noise! You'll have noise
enough before long. The regulars are coming!" Just
then the window opened, and Hancock called Revere in.
Soon after Revere rode rapidly on again to warn Concord,
Massachusetts, while Adams began cleaning his gun to
join in the fight. But Hancock stopped his companion,
saying that it was their duty, as members of the Council,
to plan and think, instead of fighting.</p>

<p>The alarm enabled the patriots to conceal most of their
arms and stores, and when the British soldiers arrived
in Lexington, soon after sunrise on April 19, 1775, they
found about seventy minutemen drawn up on the green.
The leader of the minutemen bade them "Stand firm!
Don't fire until you are fired at. But if they want war,
let it begin right here."</p>

<p>The British officer, at the head of about three hundred
men, now loudly cried: "Disperse, ye rebels! Disperse!"
Then, as they did not obey, he drew his pistols. Who
fired first is a question which has never been settled, but
a few minutes later seven American patriots lay on the
ground dead, and the rest were obliged to retreat.</p>

<p>The British now marched on to Concord, where they
began to destroy the stores. Although they had fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the patriots would offer no more resistance, they soon found
they were mistaken. The minutemen were assembling
as fast as they could, and Dr. Warren addressed those at
Lexington, saying: "Keep up a brave heart. They have
begun it&mdash;that either party can do; and we'll end it&mdash;that
only we can do."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p235.jpg" width="450" height="354" alt="retreat" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Retreat from Concord.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The British guard at the Concord bridge was now attacked.
Hearing shots in that direction, the British hurried
back, to find their men falling rapidly beneath the fire of
the minutemen. The latter were posted behind every
bush, tree, barn, and stone wall all along the road, so that
the British had to retreat between two lines of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Bewildered by the constant shots of enemies they could
not see, the British soldiers soon broke ranks and rushed
blindly on, never pausing to take breath until they met
new forces at Lexington, which covered their retreat.
There the fugitives fell to the ground exhausted and panting,
their tongues hanging out of their mouths from heat
and thirst. After they recovered a little, the British, who
had marched out of Charlestown that morning playing
"Yankee Doodle" to vex the patriots, were only too
thankful to beat a retreat. When they reached their fortifications
at sundown they had lost about three hundred
men, while only eighty-eight of the patriots had fallen.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary War had begun, and the day after
the battle of Lexington the Massachusetts Congress wrote
to England: "We determine to die or be free." The
news of the first bloodshed was rapidly carried from place
to place by men on horseback. They went everywhere,
calling the people to arms. Guns were polished and
bullets cast, the women sacrificing even cherished pewter
spoons and dishes to supply the necessary ammunition.</p>

<p>The call to arms found Israel Putnam&mdash;a hero of the
last French and Indian War&mdash;plowing in his field. Unyoking
his oxen from the plow, Putnam bade a lad run for
his coat and gun, while he saddled his horse. He then
rode quickly away to take part in the struggle, which was
to last about seven years. Two other patriots, John Stark
from New Hampshire, and Benedict Arnold from Connecticut,
were equally prompt in responding to this appeal,
and it is said that in less than three days, sixteen thousand
Americans were assembled around Boston, completely
hemming in General Gage and the British troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>




<h2>LXIII. BUNKER HILL.</h2>


<p>The news of the battles at Lexington and Concord,
where, as Em´er-son says, was "fired the shot heard
round the world," traveled with remarkable speed to Ver-mont´.
There the Green Mountain Boys quickly sprang
to arms, and, under Ethan Allen, their leader, marched on
to Fort Ticonderoga. This place was in the hands of the
British, and contained large stores of arms and ammunition,
which the Americans coveted.</p>

<p>But before the Green Mountain Boys reached Ticonderoga,
Arnold joined them to assume command of their
force. As Ethan Allen refused to give it up, the two
patriots headed the force together. They came upon the
fort so unexpectedly that, at the cry of "Surrender!" the
British commander sprang out of bed and rushed to the
door, defiantly asking, "By what authority?" "In the
name of the great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!"
thundered Ethan Allen. The British officer was
forced to yield, although he knew the Green Mountain
Boys could have no such orders, for the Second Continental
Congress was to assemble only the next day. The
taking of Ticonderoga, and of Crown Point on the morrow,
proved a great help to the Revolutionary cause, for
the patriots thus secured, cannon and powder which they
were to need before long.</p>

<p>Traveling rapidly from place to place, the news of the
battle of Lexington soon spread all through the colonies.
The congressional delegates, therefore, left their homes to
meet in Philadelphia, knowing there was a great piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
work before them. One of them, George Washington,
felt it so keenly that before starting he wrote to his
brother: "It is my full intention to devote my life and
fortune to the cause we are engaged in, if needful."</p>

<p>It was well that he was so ready to serve his country,
for it was sorely in need of help. Congress no sooner
assembled, with Hancock for president, than it began to
govern the country, and called for an army of fifteen
thousand men. Adams then arose, saying he would like
to propose as general a gentleman from Virginia, whose
"skill and experience as an officer, independent fortune,
great talents, and universal character will command the
approval of all America."</p>

<p>George Washington, who had expected nothing of the
sort, and who was as modest as he was good, fled from
the room when he heard this. But every one voted for
him, and when he was called back he reluctantly accepted
the charge given him, saying: "I beg it may be remembered
by every gentleman in this room that I this day
declare, with the utmost sincerity, I do not think myself
equal to the command I am honored with." But he then
went on to say that he would do his best, and refused all
pay for his services, asking only that Congress should pay
his expenses, of which he would keep an exact account.</p>

<p>Washington wrote to his wife, at Mount Vernon: "I
should enjoy more real happiness in one month with
you at home than I have the most distant prospect of finding
abroad, if my stay were seven times seven years."
But as he always did his duty promptly and cheerfully,
he immediately set out on horseback for Boston, where the
continental troops were rapidly assembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The British, in the meantime, had withdrawn once more
into Boston, which they duly fortified by earthworks
across the Neck. Here they were soon joined by new
troops; for Generals Howe, Bur-goyne´, and Clinton had
been sent from England to put down the rebellion. On
first hearing that the British soldiers were kept in Boston
by ill-equipped and badly trained Americans, one of these
officers cried: "What! can ten thousand Yankee Doodles
shut up five thousand soldiers of the king? Only let us
get in there, and we'll soon find elbow room!" But, as
you will see, they did not find this an easy task.</p>

<p>The Americans, learning that the British were planning
to fortify Bunker Hill and Breeds Hill, back of Charlestown,
determined to prevent their doing so, if possible, by
occupying those places first. Twelve hundred men were
therefore put under command of Colonel Pres´cott, and,
after a solemn prayer, they noiselessly crept up Breeds
Hill in the darkness, and began to throw up earthworks.</p>

<p>As the patriots toiled silently on, they heard from time
to time the British sentinels cry out, "All's well!" But
when the sun rose, the British found that all was not well,
for the Americans were intrenched on Breeds Hill. Still,
thinking it would be an easy matter to dislodge the patriots,
they joyfully prepared for the battle. The Americans
did not quail when British bullets began to rain
around them, for their leader, seeing their dismay when the
first man fell, encouraged them by walking along the top of
his breastwork as coolly as if there were no danger at all.</p>

<p>General Gage, perceiving him through his telescope,
asked a Bostonian who he was, and whether he would fight.
The Bostonian proudly answered that the man's name was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
William Prescott, and added: "Fight? Yes, yes! you
may depend upon him to do that to the very last drop of
blood in his veins." In the meantime, Prescott charged
his men, who had few
rounds of ammunition, not
to fire until he bade them,
or until they could see the
whites of the enemies' eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p240.jpg" width="450" height="393" alt="bunker" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Battle of Bunker Hill.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This order was so manfully obeyed that when the redcoats
climbed the hill they fell in swaths before the
patriots' rifles. Twice the British fell back dismayed
before this deadly fire, and twice their officers bravely
rallied them and led them back. But Prescott kept up the
courage of his men until, seeing that they had no more
bullets, he bade them retreat, using their guns as clubs,
since they had no bayonets. The gallant Warren, who
had gone into this fight saying, "Sweet and fitting it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
die for one's country," fell on the very spot where Bunker
Hill Monument how stands; and Prescott bravely covered
the retreat of his men, being the last to leave the works.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p241.jpg" width="250" height="349" alt="bunker hill" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Bunker Hill Monument.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In this battle, which is
called the "battle of
Bunker Hill," the British
drove the patriots away,
but at the cost of so
many lives that when the
news reached Europe a
French statesman said:
"Two more such victories,
and England will
have no army left in
America." Not only did
many British soldiers
perish, but as the Americans
discovered that
the only cause of their
defeat on this occasion
was lack of ammunition,
they looked forward to the next battle without fear.</p>

<p>All felt, as Ward said, that "We shall finally come off
victorious, and triumph over the enemies of freedom and
America." This belief, however, was not shared in England,
although Franklin proved that it had cost the mother
country three million pounds and many men to kill about
three hundred and fifty Yankees. He added that in the
meantime so many children had been born in our country
that, at that rate, it would be impossible to find men and
money enough to conquer the whole territory.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>




<h2>LXIV. THE BOSTON BOYS.</h2>


<p>The news of the battle of Bunker Hill, and of Howe's
setting fire to Charlestown during the struggle, was
sent without delay to Congress. The messenger who
bore it met Washington on his way to Cambridge to take
command of the army. The general in chief eagerly
asked how the Americans had behaved, and when he
heard that they had stood their ground bravely, he fervently
cried: "The liberties of the country are safe!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p242.jpg" width="250" height="236" alt="elm" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Cambridge Elm.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The messenger then continued on his way, and when
the news reached Congress there was great excitement.
The patriots felt that the fight could now end only when
their rights were assured; and Franklin wrote to some
friends in England:
"England has lost her
colonies forever."</p>

<p>Riding on, Washington
quickly reached
Cambridge, where he
made his headquarters
in the house later occupied
by the famous
American poet Longfellow.
In the beginning
of July, 1775, standing
under the Cambridge
Elm, Washington took command of the continental army,
composed of about fifteen thousand men of every age and
size. They were armed with hunting rifles, knives, swords,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
or pitchforks; most of them had no idea of military drill
or discipline, and all were in need of arms, ammunition,
uniforms, and food.</p>

<p>It was impossible to fight without three of these things;
so while the patriots brought food for the soldiers, Washington
bestirred himself to secure arms and ammunition,
begging Congress to supply hunting shirts, so that his
army might present a more orderly appearance. To prevent
the enemy from discovering, through spies, that he had
less than half a pound of powder for each man, Washington
had a number of barrels filled with sand. A little
powder was put on top of each, and they were stored
away and guarded as carefully as if there were the greatest
danger of their exploding at any minute.</p>

<p>While waiting for the artillery which Ethan Allen had
secured at Ticonderoga to be brought across country on
ox sleds, Washington and his aids drilled their ungainly
troops. But the patriots were independent and hard to
manage. It is said that when a corporal once bade a private
get a pail of water, the latter coolly answered: "I
won't. Get it yourself. I got the last pail; it is your
turn now."</p>

<p>The officers, on the other hand, seemed afraid to lower
themselves by doing any work. Washington, hearing a
corporal urge his men to remove a log which was too
heavy for them, suggested to the corporal that in such
cases it was well to lend a hand. But the man proudly
answered: "Do you realize that I am a corporal?"
Feeling that example would be better than preaching,
Washington dismounted, lent a vigorous hand to the
men, and, when the log was in place, showed them his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
uniform and rode off, bidding the men call for him whenever
they needed help.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p244.jpg" width="450" height="341" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Washington and the Corporal.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We are told that on another occasion he found some Marblehead
fishermen and Virginia riflemen quarreling. Unable
to bring them to order in any other way, Washington,
who was more than six feet tall and very strong, strode
into their midst, and, seizing the noisiest by their collars,
shook them until he brought them back to their senses.</p>

<p>For eight months Washington waited and drilled, keeping
the British shut up in Boston. Here the officers tried
to kill time by writing and acting plays, and it is said that
the most clever of all these productions was a work by
An´dré making fun of Washington. The British soldiers,
having nothing to do, annoyed the citizens, and so often
spoiled the children's play on the Common, that a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of big boys finally went to General Gage to complain
about it.</p>

<p>The British general angrily asked: "What! Have your
fathers sent you here to exhibit the rebellion they have been
teaching you?" But the boys bravely answered: "Nobody
sent us. We have never injured your troops, but they have
trampled down our snow hills and broken the ice of our
skating pond. We complained, and they called us young
rebels, and told us to help ourselves if we could. We told
the captain, and he laughed at us. Yesterday our works
were destroyed for the third time, and we will bear it no
longer."</p>

<p>The boys' spirited reply could not but appeal to
General Gage, who said to some people standing near
him: "The very children draw in a love of liberty with
the air they breathe." Then, turning to the boys, he
added: "Go, my brave boys, and be assured that if my
troops trouble you again they shall be punished."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXV. THE BRITISH LEAVE BOSTON.</h2>


<p>While Washington was holding the British prisoners
in Boston, Congress made one more vain attempt to
be on good terms with the king. But the only answer he
made to their petition was to call for more soldiers.
Finding that the English, who in many cases thought the
Americans were right, would not fight for him, he hired
seventeen thousand Hessian and other German soldiers
to put down the rebellion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The news that the king was hiring Germans and bribing
the Indians on the frontier to make trouble, made the
Americans very angry. On the same day, they heard
that the British had burned down Fal´moŭth (Portland),
in Maine, so they determined to take active measures.</p>

<p>Knowing that the Ca-na´di-ans under Carle´ton would
soon march southward, they sent two armies to the north.
One, under Mont-gom´er-y, passed up Lake Champlain
and soon took Montreal. The other army, although it
was winter, heroically forced its way through the Maine
woods to Quebec, led by Benedict Arnold.</p>

<p>There Montgomery joined Arnold; but their combined
forces proved too weak to take the city. Montgomery
fell in the very beginning of the fight, and Arnold, who
had behaved like a hero, was badly wounded. Before he
could recover and make a new attempt to seize Quebec,&mdash;where
much ammunition was stored,&mdash;new British troops
came and drove the American forces out of Canada.</p>

<p>Washington, as we have seen, was seemingly idle, only
because his troops needed drilling and he had no powder.
As he did not wish the enemy to know this, he kept the
secret until many people began to murmur because he
spent the winter in Cambridge with Mrs. Washington,
without striking a blow. He had, however, been far from
idle, for, besides drilling his army, he had made many
arrangements, and provided that the American prisoners
should be kindly treated or exchanged. To do this, he
wrote to General Gates, who had fought by his side at
Monongahela twenty years before, promising that the
British prisoners should receive just the same care as was
given to the Americans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the cannons came from Ticonderoga, Washington
resolved to attack Boston, in spite of the objections
of his officers. The principal house owners there had
long urged him to do so, notwithstanding the fact that
their property would suffer greatly. One night, therefore,
he bade his men secretly climb and fortify Dor´ches-ter
Heights. When the British awoke the next morning, they
saw that the American guns covered them. Rather than
stand such a deadly fire, General Howe decided to leave
the town. His troops, and about nine hundred of his
friends, went on board the British vessels in the harbor,
and sailed off to Hal´i-fax.</p>

<p>On St. Patrick's day, 1776, Washington triumphantly
entered Boston, where his troops were received with every
demonstration of great joy. Indeed, the Bostonians were
so happy that they gave Washington a gold medal, on one
side of which he is represented on horseback, pointing to
the vanishing British fleet.</p>

<p>But Washington did not linger there long. Suspecting
that Howe's next attempt would be to seize New York,
and fearing lest he might have gone there straight from
Boston, Washington soon hurried away. Just before he
left the city, a British ship, laden with powder, sailed into
the harbor, as its captain thought the British were still
there. Its cargo was quickly seized, and provided the
American army with seven times more powder than they
had been able to secure by any other means.</p>

<p>About three months later a second British fleet, under
Clinton, suddenly appeared off Charleston, where it began
bombarding Fort Moultrie (moo´trī). The governor of
Charleston having sent word to the general, "Keep cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and do mischief," the fire was promptly returned. Besides,
the British were greatly dismayed to see their cannon
balls burying themselves harmlessly in the soft palmetto
logs and the big sand heaps of which the fort was composed.
But the balls from the fort crippled the British
vessels so badly that they had to sail away again without
taking possession of Charleston.</p>

<p>In the midst of this battle, a British cannon ball cut Fort
Moultrie's flagstaff in two, and brought down the flag.
The enemy cheered loudly at this lucky shot; but a sergeant
named Jasper quickly jumped over the parapet,
caught up the fallen flag, and set it up again, notwithstanding
the hail of bullets falling around him; so that
it was now the Americans' turn to raise a cheer of
triumph. In reward for his daring action, Jasper was
offered the rank of lieutenant; but as he could neither
read nor write, he sadly refused it, saying: "I am not fit
for the company of officers."</p>

<h2>LXVI. DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</h2>


<p>In June, 1776, Richard Henry Lee brought into Congress
a resolution "that these United Colonies are, and
of right ought to be, free and independent States." This
was now the opinion of the principal men in our country,
and Washington wrote: "When I took command of the
army, I abhorred the idea of independence; now I am
convinced nothing else will save us."</p>

<p class="center">Signing the Declaration of Independence.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The minds of the people having been prepared for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a><br /><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
change by a little pamphlet called "Common Sense,"
Congress appointed five men to draw up a Declaration of
Independence. These
five men were Thomas
Jef´fer-son, Benjamin
Franklin, John Adams,
Roger Sherman, and
Robert Liv´ing-ston;
but as the paper, with the exception of a few words, is
the work of Jefferson, he is generally called the "Father
of the Declaration of Independence."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus_p250.jpg" width="350" height="130" alt="desk" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Jefferson's Writing Desk.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On July 4, 1776, this paper was adopted by Congress,
after hours of discussion. In the meantime, crowds of
people were anxiously waiting in the street in front of the
old statehouse in Philadelphia to hear the decision of
the Congress. A story says that the old bell ringer was
at his post, ready to proclaim the glad news as soon as
he received the signal from a grandson stationed below
But time seemed so long to the old man that he muttered
again and again: "They'll never do it." All at once,
however, a little lad darted out of the statehouse, clapping
his hands and shouting: "Ring, grandpa! Ring!"</p>

<p>Then the Independence Bell, which, strange to relate,
bore the inscription, "Proclaim liberty throughout all the
land unto all the inhabitants thereof," pealed out loud
and clear, announcing the birth of the United States of
America! All the other bells took up the joyful strain,
and the news, flying from place to place, was welcomed
everywhere.</p>

<p>John Hancock, president of Congress, was the first to
sign the Declaration of Independence, writing his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
in large, plain letters, and saying: "There; John Bull can
read my name without spectacles. Now let him double
the price on my head, for this is my defiance." Then he
turned to the other members, and solemnly added: "We
must be unanimous [of one mind]; there must be no pulling
different ways; we must all hang together."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Franklin, quaintly: "we must all hang together,
or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."</p>

<p>We are told that Charles Carroll, thinking his writing
looked shaky, added the words "of Carrollton," so that
the king should not be able to make any mistake as to
whose name stood there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p251.jpg" width="450" height="330" alt="Statehouse" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Pennsylvania Statehouse.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Copies of the Declaration of Independence were
promptly sent to every colony, where it was solemnly
read. In Pennsylvania this reading took place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
yard in front of the statehouse, which has ever since
then been known as Independence Hall. It was there that
the Liberty Bell hung, and pealed out the happy news.
When the tidings reached New York, they were joyfully
received by the army, and the Sons of Liberty pulled
down King George's leaden statue. They later sent it to
Connecticut, where patriot women broke it up and melted
it to make bullets for the army.</p>

<p>At the same time, fault began to be found with the
name of King's College, which had been established in
New York over twenty years. But nothing was done till
after the war, when the name was changed to Columbia
College.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1776 Howe came into New York Bay
with twenty-five thousand men, and soon after landed on
Stat´en Island. In coming to New York, Howe was carrying
out part of a great plan which had been made to
separate the southern from the New England colonies.
To do this, he was to march up the Hudson, while Carleton
came south from Canada by way of Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>This plan was, as you see, very cleverly laid; but it was
not so easy to carry out as the British expected. Although
Carleton marched south and won a victory over Arnold at
Valcour (val-coor´) Island, in Lake Champlain, it was at
such a cost that he soon retreated in haste, instead of
pressing on.</p>

<p>Soon after General Howe reached New York Bay, his
brother, Lord Howe, made a proclamation offering pardon
to all who would lay down their arms and promise to obey
the king. Next, he sent an officer to the American camp,
with this proclamation in a letter addressed to "George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Washington, Esq." Washington, knowing that he must
uphold the dignity of his country, rightly refused to receive
any letter addressed to him as a private citizen. He said
that George Washington, the Virginia planter, would not
be at home to receive letters until the war was over, and
that the general in chief of the American army could not
receive any letters unless they bore the proper address.</p>

<p>Lord Howe now sent a second missive, addressed to
"George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.;" but Washington
also refused that. Seeing that the American general
would not yield, Lord Howe ever after sent his letters
properly directed, although he hated to do so, because it
seemed to acknowledge the new government.</p>

<p>We are told that it was sometime during Washington's
sojourn in New York that the British bribed a man to
throw poison into the general's dish of pease. But, thanks
to the warning of a faithful servant, Washington, although
very fond of them, did not eat any, and thus escaped
death.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXVII. A LADY'S WAY OF HELPING.</h2>


<p>While Washington was in New York, Putnam had
charge of the troops on Long Island. Here General
Howe suddenly came upon him with such a large force
that Putnam was beaten and forced to retreat. Washington,
who saw the battle of Long Island from a distance, is
reported to have wrung his hands, and to have cried, with
tears running down his cheeks: "My God! what brave
fellows I must lose this day!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>At nightfall, the Americans were intrenched on Brooklyn
Heights, where Howe planned to take the "nest of
rebels" by siege. But, thanks to a fog which rose over
the bay, Washington cleverly and noiselessly drew off
these troops, and when the sun rose on the second day,
Howe found that the Americans were all on the other side of
the East River. Knowing that Howe would pursue him,
and not wishing to expose New York city to the enemy's
cannon, Washington began to retreat up the Hudson.</p>

<p>While part of the British army landed near the Battery,
the rest, under Howe himself, crossed the East River higher
up, so as to cut off the retreat of the Americans under
Putnam. To prevent this, Washington stationed troops
at the landing at Kips Bay (where East Thirty-fourth
Street now ends), bidding them hold the British at bay
long enough to enable Putnam to retreat. But the
Americans fled at the first fire, although Washington
tried to stop them. In his rage and despair over their
cowardice, Washington is said to have flung his hat on the
ground, and bitterly cried: "Are these the men with whom
I am to defend America?"</p>

<p>Still, one man could not hold an army in check; so
Washington rode northward, sending word to Putnam to
hurry, and begging Mrs. Murray, a lady living on a hill
near by, to use her woman's wit to detain the enemy.
Mrs. Murray bade her servants prepare refreshments, and
when General Howe rode past her gate, she stepped out
to invite him into her house.</p>

<p>It was a very warm day, the house looked cool and
inviting, and Howe accepted, thinking a few moments'
delay would not do any harm. But the ladies proved so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
entertaining, and the food they set before the officers so
welcome, that instead of staying only a few moments, they
lingered there several hours. Finally a servant came in
and whispered something to Mrs. Murray, who, rising
from her seat, begged Howe to accompany her to see
something which she thought might interest him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus_p255.jpg" width="200" height="387" alt="hale" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Hale statue</p></div>
</div>

<p>We are told that she then led the British general to an
upper window, and pointed out Putnam's army vanishing
in the dim distance. The delay had enabled the Americans
to escape to a point higher up, where they still held Forts
Lee and Washington, on either side of the river.</p>

<p>While the battle of Long Island was raging, Washington,
needing information, sent Nathan Hale, a Yale
graduate, into the British ranks. This
brave youth was betrayed by a former
friend, and the British, having taken
him captive, condemned him to be
hanged as a spy. This was no more
than the young man expected; but
they cruelly refused him a Bible or
a minister to prepare for death.</p>

<p>We are told that even his last letters
to his mother and betrothed were
torn to pieces before his eyes, as they
dragged him off to the gallows. But
as the young patriot stood there, surrounded
by foes, he firmly said: "I
regret only that I have but one life
to lose for my country." These noble words are carved
on the pedestal of his statue, which now stands in one of
the principal squares of New York city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Howe and Clinton were now both in New York, where
they were warmly welcomed by a few persons who were
still faithful to King George. But as they had failed to
secure the American army, they soon set out to pursue
Washington, who slowly retreated before them.</p>

<p>Washington did not try to do more than check their
advance, because he knew their ships could sail up the
Hudson, across which he had vainly tried to make a
barrier by sinking some old ships. Step by step, therefore,
Washington withdrew until he came to White Plains.
There a battle was fought; but, while the Americans were
defeated, the British retreated on the next day, rather than
renew the fight and lose more men.</p>

<p>Washington had left General Nathanael Greene in
charge of Fort Washington, telling him to forsake it rather
than run any risk of losing his troops. But Greene
thought it would be safe to remain there awhile longer.
Unfortunately, however, a traitor gave General Howe the
plans of the place, thus enabling him to surprise and capture
Fort Washington, together with three thousand men.</p>

<p>These soldiers, like many other American prisoners,
were sent on board a rotting ship in New York harbor,
where, in the course of the Revolutionary War, more than
eleven thousand men died from bad food, bad water, and
bad air. These victims of British cruelty were first buried
in the mud at low tide, but their remains now rest in
Washington Park, Brooklyn. A memorial monument has
also been erected in their honor in Trinity Church, bearing
the inscription: "To those great and good men who
died while imprisoned in this city, for their devotion to
the cause of American Independence." This honor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
well deserved, for soldiers who die of disease or in captivity
are just as likely to be heroes as those who fall on
the battlefield.</p>

<p>Washington, seeing his fort taken, now went to Hack´en-sack,
sending orders to General Charles Lee to cross
the Hudson and join him in New Jersey. But instead of
obeying promptly, Lee delayed so long that, as you will
soon see, he hampered Washington greatly. The British,
in the meantime, crossed the river, and Greene was obliged
to leave Fort Lee in hot haste. Indeed, the enemy were
so near that they found the soup pots still boiling on
the fire, and merrily ate the dinner which was to have
been served for the Americans.</p>

<p>Still faithful to his plan to worry and check the British,
without meeting them in open battle, Washington now
slowly retreated across New Jersey. We are told that he
often left a place as the enemy came in; and because he
thus imitated the tactics of a Roman general, you will
often hear him called the "American Fā´bi-us."</p>

<p>Corn-wal´lis, the British general now in charge, pursued
the Americans as fast as he could, in order to force them
to meet him in pitched battles. But while the armies
were often close enough to hear the music of each other's
bands, and there were many small skirmishes, no real
battle took place.</p>

<p>In one of these small engagements the wads used in
loading the guns gave out. The chaplain of the regiment,
who hated the British because they had cruelly shot his
wife and baby, rushed into a church, tore up some hymn
books, and, carrying the leaves to the soldiers for wads,
said: "Give 'em Watts, boys! Give 'em Watts!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>




<h2>LXVIII. CHRISTMAS EVE.</h2>


<p>While retreating before Cornwallis, Washington
kept sending stern orders to Lee to hasten and join
him, so that their combined forces could be used against the
British. But Lee did not obey, and came on very slowly.
Indeed, he said freely that he did not consider Washington
a good general, and often boasted that if <em>he</em> were only at
the head of the army the war would soon be over.</p>

<p>Lee was in a little inn in New Jersey, writing a letter
to General Gates expressing his opinion of Washington,
when he was suddenly surrounded by the British and
made a prisoner. Without giving him time to change his
dressing-gown and slippers, or get into his uniform, the
British bore him off in triumph, thinking they had taken
the most clever of all the American generals. But Lee
was really no loss, and his army, having fortunately gone
on ahead, joined Washington sooner without a general
than it would have done had Lee been there.</p>

<p>Many of the Americans now fancied, like the British,
that since Lee was a prisoner their mainstay was gone.
Besides, the British began to threaten to illtreat Lee,
and as the Americans held no British generals as
prisoners, they could not offer an exchange. Knowing
this, a Rhode Island officer named Barton made a bold
plan.</p>

<p>He had heard that the British General Prescott was
quartered on the seashore not very far from Newport.
Taking a party of forty brave seamen and soldiers, he rowed
with muffled oars right through the British fleet, one dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
night. Then a sentinel was noiselessly killed, and the
small force surrounded the house where Prescott lay
asleep. A moment later the Americans burst into his
bedroom, bore him off half clothed to their boats, and,
rowing away in safety, sent word to the British that Prescott
should receive just the same treatment that they gave
Lee. Nine months later an exchange was made, and Lee
and Prescott went back to their posts (1778).</p>

<p>In the meantime Washington still avoided a battle, and
retreated to the Delaware. There, having cleverly secured
every boat within a hundred miles, he took his
army over the river. When the British came up, not a
single boat was to be had; so they camped near the stream,
thinking it would soon freeze hard enough to allow them
to cross on the ice and seize Philadelphia.</p>

<p>This was a time of great trial for the Americans, and
Washington was the only man who did not despair. Still,
the British had set a price upon his head, and were loudly
boasting that they would soon hang him. Speaking of
this, Washington once told his friend Joseph Reed: "My
neck does not feel as though it were made for a halter."
Then he added that if things came to the worst they
would have to retreat into Virginia, or even over the
Alleghanies, but that they must never give up the struggle
they had begun.</p>

<p>Congress, fearing the British would carry out their plan
and seize Philadelphia, now hastily withdrew to Baltimore.
But before leaving, Samuel Adams wrote: "Let America
exert her own strength, and He who cannot be indifferent
to her righteous cause will even work miracles, if necessary,
to establish her feet upon a rock."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Washington, as we have seen, was very prudent; but
he was not lacking in courage. Seeing that the British
forces were scattered, he now thought it a fine chance to
win a victory, which would rekindle the ardor of his men
and give new courage to all the nation.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p><small><i>Emanuel Leutze, Artist.</i></small></p>

<p class="center">Washington crossing the Delaware.</p></div>
</div>

<p>He therefore planned to surprise the Hessians at Trenton
by crossing the river, in spite of huge cakes of
floating ice which nearly blocked it. Marblehead fishermen
were put in charge of the boats, and such was their
skill and daring that they took twenty-four hundred men
safely over. This crossing of the Delaware on Christmas
night (1776) was one of the most daring feats ever performed.
Besides, the men were only half clad, and so
badly shod that they left bloody footprints in the snow;
and the cold was so intense that night, that two of their
number were actually frozen to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of drifting snow and driving wind, Washington's
force marched bravely on, and surprised the Hessians
at Trenton. The wounded commander, Rahl, was forced
to surrender, and his whole army was seized. We are
told that the Hessian soldiers had been so busy keeping
Christmas that they were all half drunk, and that Rahl
himself was too absorbed in a game of cards to read a
note sent to warn him of his peril. Thinking it a matter
of no importance, he thrust it into his pocket unread, and
thus he and his men fell into Washington's hands.</p>

<p>The news of the victory of Trenton filled the hearts of
the Americans with great joy, but it proved a bitter disappointment
to Cornwallis. Fancying the war all over, he
had packed his trunks and gone on board a vessel to return
to England. But now General Howe sent him back
in haste to Trenton to fight Washington. Hedged in
between a river full of floating ice and a large army, it
now seemed as if Washington could not escape.</p>

<p>One evening, therefore, Cornwallis gleefully told one of
his officers that they would "bag the old fox" on the
next day. The officer suggested that it might be better
not to postpone it till the morrow; but Cornwallis answered
that this time the Americans could not escape. That
same night, however, Washington took advantage of the
fact that the roads froze hard enough to enable him to remove
his cannon, and slipped away by back roads, leaving
his camp fires burning brightly so as to deceive the enemy.
When the British awoke the next morning, the "old fox"
was gone, and sounds of firing in the direction of Prince´ton
soon convinced them that a battle must be going on
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Running into Cornwallis's tent, an officer roused him,
crying: "To arms, general! Washington has outgeneraled
us. Let us fly to the rescue of Princeton!" But,
notwithstanding all their haste, they reached Princeton
only after the battle&mdash;on the present college grounds&mdash;was
all over, and the victorious Washington had safely advanced
to Mor´ris-town Heights. This campaign, in the dead of
winter, was so wonderful that it won for Washington the
title of "Savior of his Country," and Frederick the Great
of Prussia once said that it was the most brilliant piece of
generalship in the pages of history.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXIX. THE FIGHT AT BENNINGTON.</h2>


<p>While Washington was spending the rest of the
winter at Morristown, the news of his triumphs
reached France. Franklin had been sent there, in 1776,
to secure help, if possible. His reputation as a man of
science, his great talents, and his affable manners made
him a great favorite in Paris, where the fashionable
ladies and gentlemen carried fans and snuffboxes decorated
with his portrait. But although both king and queen
received Franklin very graciously, they would not at first
promise him any aid.</p>

<p>A young French nobleman named La-fā-yette´, longing
to help the Americans, now decided to leave his young
wife and home. But as the king forbade him to leave
court, he secretly embarked upon a vessel he fitted out
himself, and crossed the Atlantic. Then, as soon as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
landed, he went straight to Congress and offered to serve
the United States without pay. A few days later he met
Washington, whose helper he became, and who soon learned
to love him as dearly as if he had been his own son.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p263.jpg" width="450" height="511" alt="Lafayette" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Washington and Lafayette.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Several other illustrious foreigners came in the same
way to fight for America and freedom. The bravest
among them were the Germans De Kalb´ and Steu´ben,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and the Poles Pu-las´kĭ and Kos-ci-us´ko. It is said that
when Kosciusko first presented himself, and was asked
what he could do, he briefly answered: "Try me." This
reply so pleased Washington that he made the young man
his aid-de-camp.</p>

<p>Washington's victories at Trenton and Princeton, and
his return toward New York, could not divert Howe from
his purpose to secure Philadelphia. When summer came
on, therefore, he set out with his fleet to take that city.
Washington began retracing his steps, and, knowing that
Howe could not sail up the Delaware,&mdash;which was defended
by forts,&mdash;went to meet him at Chadds Ford on
the Bran´dy-wine (1777). Here a battle was fought, and
not only were the Americans defeated, but Lafayette was
sorely wounded.</p>

<p>Although beaten, Washington's army retreated in good
order to Philadelphia, which was soon taken by Howe and
the British forces. Hoping to drive them away, Washington
surprised them, one morning, at Germantown. Here
he would have won a brilliant victory, had not a dense fog
made two divisions of his men shoot each other before
they discovered their mistake, thus creating a panic.</p>

<p>As there was nothing to be gained by fighting with
exhausted troops, Washington now withdrew, and before
long went to Valley Forge for the winter. Meanwhile,
Howe attacked the forts on either side of the Delaware
River. One of these held out bravely for six days, refusing
to surrender until it had been battered to pieces.
Then, as one fort alone could not check the British fleet,
the second surrendered also.</p>

<p>Hoping to damage some of the British vessels at Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the patriots made rude torpedoes, which were
placed inside of small kegs and sent floating down the
river. One of these engines struck a cake of ice and exploded,
and the British, thus warned of danger, shot at
every floating object they saw, thus waging what has
been called in fun the "Battle of the Kegs."</p>

<p>The British, having nothing else to do, now settled
down comfortably in Philadelphia, where they lived on
the very best of everything. They spent most of their
time giving balls and parties, and grew so fat and lazy
that, as Franklin wittily said, "Howe has not taken Philadelphia
so much as Philadelphia has taken Howe." This
remark proved true, for although the plan had been
that Howe should march northward, he was delayed by
Washington until it was almost too late. Besides, we are
told that the British general never received positive orders
to go north, for the paper, being badly written, was laid
aside to be copied, and forgotten until too late.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the British again tried to carry out their
plan of invading New York from Canada. This time,
while one army started from Lake Ontario for the Mo´hawk
valley, Burgoyne came southward up Lake Champlain,
with British and Indian troops, and took Forts Ticonderoga
and Edward. This was considered a great victory
in England, and when King George heard that Ticonderoga
was taken, he clapped his hands and shouted: "I
have beat them! I have beat all the Americans!"</p>

<p>This was not true, however. But General Schuȳ´ler,
sent to oppose Burgoyne, had so small a force that all
he could do was to hinder the enemy's advance by cutting
down trees and destroying bridges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>The king's advisers had told Burgoyne to hire Indians
to help him, and in spite of all he could do to prevent it,
these savage allies fought with their usual cruelty. They
even killed and scalped Jane McCreā, a beautiful young
lady, who, it is said, was on her way to meet a British
officer to whom she was engaged. When this man saw
her long golden locks among the scalps the Indians brought
back, he left the army, and spent the rest of his life alone,
mourning for his betrothed.</p>

<p>After taking the two forts, Burgoyne, hearing that there
were cannon and stores at Ben´ning-ton, Vermont, sent part
of his German troops thither to secure them. But when
his men drew near this place, they found it ably defended
by General Stark.</p>

<p>Even as a boy, this American patriot had always shown
great courage and presence of mind. Once, when a
prisoner of the Indians, and forced to run the gantlet.
Stark snatched a club from one of his captors, and
struck right and left with such vigor that he dealt more
blows than he received. Later on, he also did many brave
deeds during the French and Indian wars.</p>

<p>When the Germans drew near Bennington, Stark led his
men against the foe, crying: "There they are, boys! We
beat them to-day or Molly Stark's a widow." The men,
fired by his example, fought so bravely that they soon
won a signal victory. As Washington said, this was a
"grand stroke," for the Germans were almost all captured
or killed, while only a few of the Americans were lost.</p>

<p>We are told that one old man had five sons in this
battle. On the morrow, a neighbor, wishing to break the
news of one son's death, gently said: "One of your sons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
has been unfortunate." "Did he run away or neglect
his duty?" the father asked quickly. "No; worse than
that! He has fallen, but while fighting bravely." "Ah!"
said the father, "then I am satisfied!" For the old man
was such a good patriot that he was quite willing his sons
should die for their country, and considered that only
traitors and cowards needed pity.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXX. BURGOYNE'S SURRENDER.</h2>


<p>The victory at Bennington not only saved the American
cannon and supplies from the hands of the foe,
but enabled Stark and the Green Mountain Boys to get
between Burgoyne and Canada. They thus cut him off
from all help from the north, whence he expected both
food and ammunition for his men.</p>

<p>While Burgoyne was thus between Generals Schuyler
and Stark, St. Lěġ´er, another British general, was coming
along the Mohawk valley to join Burgoyne at Albany.
On his way, however, he stopped to besiege Fort Stan´wix,
or Schuyler. Eight hundred volunteers set out to reinforce
the garrison, but on the way thither, at O-ris´ka-ny,
they were surprised by the Indian chief Brant. Their
leader, General Her´ki-mer, mortally wounded in the very
beginning of the engagement, bade his men place him
under a tree, and then bravely said: "Now, go and fight.
I will face the enemy." In spite of pain, he calmly lighted
his pipe, and, while smoking, directed his troops with such
vigor that before long the Indians were routed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The garrison at Fort Stanwix, hearing shots in the
forest, made a brave sortie, in which they captured five
flags from St. Leger. These they hoisted above their fort,
upside down, putting above them all a new flag made from
pieces of a soldier's old shirt, a blue jacket, and a red flannel
petticoat. Although fashioned from such queer materials,
this flag bore thirteen alternate red and white
stripes, and in a blue field in one corner was a wreath of
thirteen white stars, the number of the United States.
This was the new American flag suggested by Washington&mdash;whose
coat of arms bore stars and stripes&mdash;and
adopted by Congress in June, 1777.</p>

<p>But while the patriots thus fashioned a rude flag in the
wilderness, and were the first to fight under this emblem,
it was Mrs. Ross, of Philadelphia, who made the first
American flag of this kind, in June, 1777.</p>

<p>When Schuyler heard of Herkimer's brave stand, and
of the bold sortie from Fort Stanwix, he bade Arnold go
and relieve the fort. Fearing that his force might not
prove strong enough, Arnold made use of a trick. He
told one of the prisoners, a half-witted lad, that he should
be free if he would only do exactly as he was bidden.
The lad agreed, and, clad in torn garments, ran to St.
Leger's camp, loudly shouting, "The Americans are coming!"
Of course the British and Indians crowded around
him, and when the idiot was asked how many men were
on the way, he answered by pointing mysteriously to the
leaves on the trees overhead. This strange behavior made
St. Leger believe that a large force was advancing, and
created such a panic among his men that, in spite of all
he could do, they beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>As St. Leger had gone back, and Howe had not come
up the Hudson, Burgoyne was left entirely alone in the
heart of the enemy's country. Schuyler was therefore on
the point of winning a glorious victory, after all his hard
work, when Congress suddenly bade him give up his command
to General Gates. Although wounded to the quick
by this order, Schuyler was too noble a man to show any
anger. He gallantly said, "The country before everything,"
and asked permission of Gates to serve as an officer
under him, since he could no longer command.</p>

<p>Burgoyne was surrounded, and seeing that he must
fight, he advanced toward the American position on
Be´mis Heights, near which the first battle of Săr-a-tō´ga
took place. But night came on before it was over, and
for more than two weeks the armies stood face to face,
watching each other closely, yet not daring to risk a new
battle. Finally, seeing that he must fight, starve, or retreat,
Burgoyne marched out again, to face the Americans
in what is known as the battle of Still´wa-ter.</p>

<p>Daniel Morgan and his sharpshooters, posted behind trees,
carefully singled out the bravest men, and shot them with
unerring aim. Indeed, such was their skill that it is said
Morgan's riflemen could "toss up an apple and shoot all
the seeds out of it as it fell."</p>

<p>Chief among the British officers on that day was General
Fra´ser, who, when urged to take a less exposed position,
simply replied: "My duty forbids me to fly from danger."
Even while he was speaking thus, Morgan pointed him out
to one of his best marksmen, saying: "That gallant officer
is General Fraser. I admire and honor him; but he must
die. Stand among those bushes, and do your duty."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
These orders were so promptly carried out that a moment
later Fraser lay among the dead.</p>

<p>Arnold had been unjustly deprived of his command,
but he could not keep out of the fray. Dashing to the
front, he led the advance with his usual bravery, and
forced his way into the British camp. But as he reached
it he fell wounded in the same leg which had suffered at
Quebec. His men tenderly bore him off the field of battle,
where he had won a victory while General Gates was
lingering in his tent.</p>

<p>During the battle, some women and children who were
with the British army crouched in terror in the cellar of a
neighboring house, listening to the shriek of the cannon
balls overhead. The wounded in this building clamored
for water, until, knowing the men would perish if they
ventured out, a soldier's wife marched boldly down to the
river. She did this several times, in full view of the Americans,
who admired her courage and let her alone.</p>

<p>The battle had raged so fiercely that Burgoyne retreated
to Saratoga, where he held a council of war to
determine whether he should surrender. In the midst of
his talk, an eighteen-pound cannon ball passed right over
the table where he and his officers sat, so they quickly and
wisely concluded that it was high time to give up (1777).
The British soldiers, therefore, laid down their arms, and
the Americans marched into their camp playing "Yankee
Doodle," the tune they had adopted as a national air.</p>

<p>We are told that Burgoyne, on handing Gates his sword
in token of surrender, proudly remarked: "The fortune
of war, General Gates, has made me your prisoner"; to
which Gates answered, as he gave it back: "I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
always be ready to bear testimony that it has not been
through any fault of your Excellency." Later on, touched
by the courtesy of Schuyler, whose house he had burned
down, Burgoyne said: "You show me much kindness,
though I have done you much injury." "That was the
fate of war," said Schuyler, kindly; "let us say no more
about it."</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXI. THE WINTER AT VALLEY FORGE.</h2>


<p>Although Gates received all the credit at first, the
two battles of Saratoga were really won by Schuyler,
Morgan, and Arnold. Burgoyne's surrender proved
the turning point of the Revolutionary War, so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
fight at Saratoga is known as one of the decisive battles of
the world. Not only did it end the British plan of separating
New England from the Southern States, but it made
the French promise to help the Americans openly. It
also gave King George such a fright that he even offered
to let the Americans send members to Parliament, if they
would lay down their arms and promise to obey him.</p>

<p>But this offer, which would have more than satisfied
the colonists a short time before, came too late. They
had suffered so much that they were not willing to give
up what they had won and again become subject to a
king who, like those who had come before him, might at
any time change his mind or break his promises. Besides,
they remembered only too clearly that, after granting
charters, kings had often taken them away again, and so
they decided to keep on fighting until the matter was
settled once for all.</p>

<p>The news of the victory at Saratoga created a great
sensation in Paris, where the French had been waiting to
see how things turned out before they openly sided with
the Americans. The king now not only acknowledged the
independence of the United Colonies of America (1778),
but made a treaty of friendship and commerce with them,
and soon sent a fleet to help them fight the British.</p>

<p>This happy turn of affairs was mainly brought about by
Franklin, who for the past two years had been making as
many friends for America as he could. Every one admired
him for his learning and good nature, and the French
minister Turgot (tur-go´) once proposed his health,
saying: "He snatched a thunderbolt from heaven, and the
scepter from the hand of the tyrant!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>But Franklin&mdash;who had a keen sense of humor, and, like
all really great men, was very modest&mdash;smiled, and quaintly
answered that while he appreciated the kindness of the
speech, he was obliged to confess that not only had he
left thunder in the clouds,&mdash;just where he had found
it,&mdash;but that more than one million of his countrymen had
helped him snatch the scepter from the hands of the tyrant!</p>

<p>News traveled so slowly in those days that it took
months before Franklin heard of Burgoyne's surrender,
and before Washington and Howe received word that the
French were going to help the colonies openly. These
months were full of hardships for all the Americans, for
while the men were away fighting, the heroic women
were obliged to do their work too.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p273.jpg" width="450" height="219" alt="forge" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">At Valley Forge.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Washington's army, as we have seen, had encamped at
Valley Forge, where the soldiers lived in rude log huts.
They were without proper food or clothes, and cowered
miserably over camp fires, for which they had to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
wood on their backs from neighboring forests. Even
General Washington had but one room, and lived on cabbage
and potatoes, with a few hickory nuts for dessert
from time to time.</p>

<p>His heart was wrung at the sight of his men's sufferings,
and as soon as his wife joined him at Valley Forge, he
begged her to work as hard as she could to supply the
men with stockings. Mrs. Washington's own knitting
needles now flew faster than ever; besides, she interested
all her friends in the work, and every day visited the
soldiers' quarters, carrying them the stout garments thus
secured. But provisions grew so scarce that Washington
had to send all the women home, and Mrs. Washington
again withdrew to Mount Vernon, where she lived as
economically as possible, working day and night for her
husband and the army.</p>

<p>As if matters were not bad enough already, some of
the officers now formed a plot to take the command away
from Washington, and put Gates at the head of the army
in his stead. This plot, known as the Conway cabal, was
headed by a man named Conway, to whom Washington
had been particularly kind, but who was angry because
he had not been promoted as fast as he wished.</p>

<p>The question was brought before Congress at Baltimore,
where, hearing that there was danger of Washington's
being dismissed for lack of a vote, Du´er, one of his friends,
although ill in bed, determined to go to the meeting. His
doctor, however, said that if he did so it would be at the
risk of his life. "Do you mean I should expire before
reaching the place?" asked Duer. "No; but I should not
answer for your leaving it alive," answered the doctor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Hearing this, the good man firmly said: "Very well, sir;
you have done your duty; now I will do mine." Then
he called for a litter to carry him to Congress.</p>

<p>Luckily for him, some of Washington's friends came
back in time to prevent his leaving his sick room. But
better still for the welfare of our country, the Conway plot
failed, and Washington remained at the head of the army.
Conway had been so ungrateful that he was forced to
leave the country, where people despised him for the mean
part he had played.</p>

<p>All these trials wrung Washington's noble heart, and
as he had no privacy in his headquarters, he sometimes
rode out alone to think. A Quaker, hearing a noise in
the bushes, once stole up cautiously, and found the general's
horse tied to a tree. A few feet farther away, he
beheld Washington kneeling in the snow, praying aloud
for his country, with great tears streaming down his
cheeks. The good Quaker crept away again unseen, but
in telling the story some years later, he remarked that he
felt at the time that the Lord could not but answer the
fervent prayer of so good a man.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXII. THE QUAKER WOMAN.</h2>


<p>The British quartered in Philadelphia were leading an
easy and merry life; but several times during the
winter Howe made plans to surprise Washington's troops.
To his dismay, however, his plans always seemed known
to the Americans, and therefore failed. Afraid that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
spy might overhear him, Howe once held a secret meeting
at night in the house of a Quaker woman, named Lydia
Darrah. To make sure that he should not be overheard,
he bade her go to bed, and see that all her family retired
likewise.</p>

<p>Lydia obeyed, and the general, thinking all was safe,
explained his plan to his officers. But the Quaker woman
had noiselessly slipped out of her room again, and was
now standing at the door listening to all that was said.
As soon as the talk was over she crept back to her room,
and when the officers had all gone, Howe called her, as
agreed, to lock the door behind him. But she pretended
to be sound asleep, and let him knock at her door three
times before she rose, yawning, to show him out.</p>

<p>The next day, Lydia, who had not dared breathe a
word of what she had heard to any one, said she was out
of flour, and got a pass to go and buy some at a village
near by. Meeting a patriot there, she quickly warned
him of Washington's peril, and then quietly went home.</p>

<p>The next day Howe crossly said to her: "It is very
strange; you, I know, were asleep, for I knocked at your
door three times before you heard me; yet it is certain
we were betrayed. On arriving, we found Washington so
prepared at every point that we have been compelled to
march back without injuring our enemy, like a parcel of
fools." Lydia heard this without making a sign, and not
till the war was over did it become known that it was she
who had saved the army.</p>

<p>Besides the American patriots, foreigners were helping
Washington with all their might. Among these was the
Prussian officer, Baron Steuben, who knew no English, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
therefore brought over an interpreter with him. According
to one story, this interpreter made an idle bet to kiss
the first Yankee girl he met. Landing at Portsmouth,
this man won his wager by stepping up to a pretty girl,
bowing politely, and begging permission to kiss her,
saying: "Before leaving my native land to fight for
American freedom, I made a vow to ask, in earnest of
victory, a kiss from the first lady I should meet." The
story adds that the young lady accepted the kiss, saying
she could not refuse so small a favor to a man who had
come to fight, and if necessary, to die, for her country.</p>

<p>Steuben joined Washington at Valley Forge, and there
began to drill the troops, so they could meet the British
on an equal footing. At first the German officer was
shocked by their lack of discipline, and swore at them in
every language he knew; sometimes he even called to his
interpreter: "Come and swear for me in English; these
fellows will not do what I bid them."</p>

<p>You see, soldiers in those days thought it manly to
swear; and as Baron Steuben had been accustomed to
European soldiers, who obeyed without a question, it
took him some time to grow used to Americans, who, as
he said, had to be told, "This is the reason why you ought
to do that," before they would obey. Still, he soon
taught our men to fight like old and trained soldiers.</p>

<p>The winter the troops spent at Valley Forge was one of
the coldest ever seen, and therefore the soldiers' sufferings
were very great. But with the spring, hope revived, for
the news of the coming French fleet made the British
leave Philadelphia to defend New York.</p>

<p>General Howe having gone back to England for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
health, it was Clinton who conducted this retreat. Leaving
the camp at Valley Forge, Washington pursued him
across New Jersey, planning to engage him in a battle at
Mon´moŭth (1778).</p>

<p>Here Lee, who had been exchanged for Prescott, and was
again in command, disobeyed orders, and bade his men
retreat. Warned by Lafayette, Washington came up just in
time to check this movement, and, dashing up to Lee, hotly
asked what his disobedience meant. Lee answered: "These
men cannot face the British grenadiers." But Washington
exclaimed: "They can do it, and they shall!" He was right;
the men could, and did, face the enemy bravely. But precious
time had been lost, and instead of winning a victory,
the Americans only managed to stand their ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p278.jpg" width="450" height="370" alt="molly" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Molly Pitcher.</p></div>
</div>

<p>During
the battle,
Molly
Pitcher, a
gunner's wife,
carrying a pail of water
to her husband,
saw him fall. She immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
rushed forward, took his place, and, loading his cannon,
fired it as quickly and well as he. In reward for filling
her husband's place that day, Congress paid her a small
pension, and the soldiers, who admired her pluck, ever
after called her "Major Molly."</p>

<p>When darkness came on, the fight ceased, and Washington
flung himself down to rest. During the night an
officer drew softly near, and the general quickly bade him
advance and deliver his message, saying: "I lie here to
think, and not to sleep." Washington's thoughts were busy,
for now he could no longer doubt that Charles Lee was
a traitor. Indeed, he foresaw what soon happened&mdash;that
Lee would be dismissed from the army in disgrace. In
fact, Lee, who had tried to harm the American cause, was
never allowed to serve his country again, and had to withdraw
to Virginia. There he lived a loveless and solitary
life, in a house whose only partitions were chalk lines
across the floor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXIII. PUTNAM'S ADVENTURES.</h2>


<p>On the morrow of the battle of Monmouth, Washington
found that Clinton had withdrawn his army so as to
avoid a second battle. The British were now well on
their way to New York, so Washington could no longer
hope to overtake them. To hem them in, however, he
stretched a line of American troops all the way from Morristown
to West Point.</p>

<p>But Washington had to abandon his plan for seizing
New York with the help of the French fleet, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the vessels drew too much water to be able to cross the
bar. As the fleet could not reach New York, it made an
attempt to seize Newport. Here it was met by British
ships; but before a battle could take place, a sudden
storm scattered both fleets, and caused so much damage
that they had to refit.</p>

<p>When Clinton saw that Washington had drawn a close
line about him in New Jersey, he tried to force the
American general to break it by attacking the towns in
Connecticut. But Washington would not stir, for he
knew that General Israel Putnam, in charge of the forces
there, was well able to look out for himself. As this
Putnam is one of the heroes of the Revolutionary War, it
will interest you to hear a few stories about him, which all
Americans should know.</p>

<p>We are told that, even as a lad, Putnam was famous for
his courage. Once, when a wolf caused great damage in
his neighbors' herds, he determined to kill it. But the
wolf withdrew into its den, where it could be reached only
by crawling along through a narrow passage. As the
creature could neither be smoked nor starved out, Putnam
offered to go in and kill it. Tying a rope to his foot, he
bade his companions pull him out when they felt the rope
twitch, or heard a shot. Then he crawled along the
passage on his stomach, carefully holding his gun. At
the end of a few minutes he came to a place where the
passage widened a little, and there, in the darkness, he
saw the yellow gleam of the big wolf's eyes! Putnam
raised his gun, shot, and was dragged out by his companions
in such haste that his clothes were actually torn off
his back, and his skin somewhat scraped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Determined to know whether the old wolf was dead,
Putnam, at the end of a few minutes, again crept into the
den. When his companions obeyed the twitch of the
rope a few minutes later, and drew him out a second time,
they thought he was very heavy; but when he got out
they found he was dragging by the leg the biggest gray
wolf they had ever seen!</p>

<p>Putnam had taken part in the last French and Indian
War. The year after the French took and destroyed Fort
William Henry, he was with a British army that encamped
on the same ground; and when this army advanced to
attack Ticonderoga, his company led the way. While they
were thus marching through the woods, the French surprised
them; and had it not been that Rogers came to
their rescue with more men, Putnam and his detachment
would have fallen. At another time, we are told, Fort
Edward took fire, and the powder magazine was in great
danger. But Putnam fought the flames inch by inch, putting
them out barely in time to prevent the explosion of
the whole store of ammunition.</p>

<p>During this French and Indian War Putnam once volunteered
to mount guard at a place where the sentinel was
always found dead in the morning. While watching there,
he heard a strange noise in the bushes, and saw what he
took in the darkness for a wild pig or a bear. He fired at
it without a moment's delay, and, on drawing near, found
he had killed an Indian, who, covered by a bearskin, and
imitating the actions of an animal, had always managed to
get near enough to the sentinels to kill them.</p>

<p>Another time, when Putnam and Rogers were sent to
recapture some baggage wagons, the latter spent the noon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
hour in target practice, although warned it was dangerous.
The Indians, guided by the sound of firing, fell upon the
British unawares, and seizing Putnam bound him to a
tree.</p>

<p>For a while Putnam found himself between the fire of
his own party and that of the Indians; and when the latter
were driven from the battlefield, they took him away with
them. After torturing him in many ways, breaking his
jaw and cutting open his cheek, the Indians tied him to a
tree and began to roast him alive.</p>

<p>The fire was raging around him when a sudden and
violent shower put it out. But as soon as the rain was
over the savages rekindled it. They would have succeeded
in roasting Putnam alive, had not a French officer
come up just then, rushed into the fire, cut him loose, and
thus saved him from a horrible death.</p>

<p>Burned, gashed, disfigured, and bowed down by weakness,
Putnam was taken to Montreal, where the other
prisoners were careful not to tell who he was. So the
French, thinking him a poor old man who would never
have the strength to fight again, gladly exchanged him
for one of their captive soldiers.</p>

<p>Putnam then went on fighting again till the war was
over. He took an active part in the capture of Montreal
in 1760, and in that of Havana two years later.</p>

<p>A British general once showed him a French vessel on
Lake Ontario, saying it must be destroyed. Putnam immediately
volunteered to destroy it, and rowing out in the
dark, he secretly drove wedges behind the rudder. As
the vessel could no longer obey its helm, it was soon
driven ashore and wrecked.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>




<h2>LXXIV. INDIAN CRUELTY.</h2>


<p>The French and Indian War ended, Putnam resumed
work on his Connecticut farm. At the time
of the Stamp Act trouble
he and some of his fellow-citizens
visited the house
of one of the men who
had stamped paper for
sale. They told him
he must not sell a single
sheet of it; and when
he objected that he must
mind the king, Putnam declared
that if he dared disobey
them his house would
"be level with the dust in
five minutes."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus_p283.jpg" width="250" height="483" alt="putnam" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Putnam's Ride.</p></div>
</div>

<p>You have already
seen how
quick Putnam was
to respond to the
call when the patriots
flew to arms.
Ever since the beginning
of the war he
had been equally
active. Called
upon to meet the
British in Connecticut,
with but very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
few men, Putnam nevertheless managed to hamper their
movements greatly.</p>

<p>On one occasion he found himself almost surrounded
by the British. Calling to his companions to save
themselves, he drew off the British soldiers, who hotly
pursued him. With the enemy on three sides of him,
and a frightfully steep and rocky slope on the other, it
seemed quite impossible that Putnam should escape. But
he boldly drove his spurs into his steed, rode safely down
the stone steps at Horse´neck, and as none of the British
dared follow him, he thus managed to get away.</p>

<p>Hearing that the British were burning farmhouses and
villages in Connecticut, Washington fancied it might be a
good plan to strike a blow which would frighten them and
make them come back. He therefore planned to storm
Stony Point, a place on the Hudson, where the British
were building a new fort.</p>

<p>Sending for Anthony Wayne, an officer who was so
brave and daring that his men generally called him "Mad
Anthony," Washington told him what he wanted. The
young man, devoted to Washington, promptly cried:
"I'll storm hell, general, if you will only plan it!" The
patriotic young soldier's answer was so well meant that
Washington, who never swore himself, and generally reproved
his men when they did so, merely smiled on this
occasion, and quietly said: "Hadn't we better try Stony
Point first?"</p>

<p>The Americans, with guns unloaded and bayonets fixed,
drew near the fort unseen, led by an old negro who often
went in and out of the British camp to sell strawberries.
He walked up to the sentinel, and whispered: "The fort is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
ours." As this was the password, the soldier began to
chat with him, and thus did not notice the Americans
creeping up behind him until they seized and gagged him.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Capture of Stony Point.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The patriots thus got halfway up the hill before the
alarm was given and firing began. Although one of the
first shots wounded Mad Anthony, he bade his men carry
him, and, cheering his soldiers on, led the way into
the fort. Taken by surprise, the British lost many men
and their new fort, and at two o'clock in the morning
Wayne wrote to Washington: "The fort and garrison,
with Colonel Johnson, are ours. Our officers and men
behaved like men who are determined to be free." This
charge at Stony Point (1779) is considered one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
brilliant deeds of the Revolutionary War, and the place
where it occurred is often visited.</p>

<p>When war first broke out the British hired many
Indians to fight for them. While the two main armies
were busy in New Jersey, southern New York, and Connecticut,
people living in northern New York, and all along
the western frontier, were in constant danger. Led by a
man named Butler, some Tories&mdash;friends of the king&mdash;and
many Indians suddenly appeared in the Wy-o´ming
Valley, in Pennsylvania. Here they cruelly murdered
men, women, and children. We are even told that a cruel
soldier once ran his bayonet through a tiny baby, and
tossed it out of its cradle, saying it was a rebel also!</p>

<p>Not satisfied with one raid of this kind, the Indians soon
made a second one at Cherry Valley, in New York. These
massacres roused the Americans' anger, not only against
the Indians, but also against the British for hiring the
help of such cruel allies. Still, it was only the king and
some of his ministers who were to blame for this, for most
Englishmen felt like Burke. When the order had been
given to make use of the Indians, but forbidding them to
be cruel, Burke made a speech in the House of Commons,
saying: "Suppose there was a riot on Tower Hill. What
would the keeper of his Majesty's lions do? Would he
not fling open the dens of the wild beasts, and then address
them thus: 'My gentle lions, my humane bears, my
tender-hearted hyenas, go forth! But I exhort you, as
you are Christians and members of civilized society, to
take care not to hurt any man, woman, or child!'"</p>

<p>To punish the Indians for the massacres at Wyoming
Valley and Cherry Valley, General Sul´li-van now marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
into the Indian territory, where he burned more than forty
villages. He also killed so many warriors that the Indians
in that part of the country never again dared rise up
against the Americans.</p>

<p>The Indian war not only raged in the northeast, but
extended even into what is now Ken-tuck´y. Although
there were but very few settlers there then, many of these
were slain. To put an end to Indian raids, General George
Rogers Clark of Virginia marched northward, hoping to
conquer all the land between the Ohio, the Lakes, and the
Mississippi.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p287.jpg" width="450" height="313" alt="clark" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Clark's March.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Although his army was small, it was composed of brave
men, used to the woods and to the Indian way of fighting.
They followed him boldly through the wilderness,
fording rivers and streams. We are told that they once
came to water so deep that their little drummer boy, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
it would rise above his head, used his drum as a
raft, begging the tallest soldier to steer him safely across.</p>

<p>Marching thus from point to point, Clark's forces took
all the forts in the Illinois country; but as he had few
men, he could not send fair-sized garrisons to all. Some
time after Vin-cennes´ submitted, a large British force
appeared to capture it, and loudly commanded the American
officer there to surrender. After some parley, this
man consented to do so, provided he and his garrison
were allowed to march out with all the honors of war.</p>

<p>The British officer granted this request; but imagine his
surprise and anger when he saw the officer march out,
followed by only one man! These two composed the
whole garrison, and could boast that they had held the
fort of Vincennes against a force of eight hundred men.
When Clark heard what had happened, he marched over
with a large force and recaptured the fort.</p>

<h2>LXXV. BOONE IN KENTUCKY.</h2>


<p>As you have heard, the land south of the Ohio suffered
much from Indian raids. This part of the country
had already been the scene of so many Indian battles that
it well deserved the name of Kentucky, or the "dark and
bloody ground." Six years before the Revolutionary
War began, Daniel Boone, a hardy pioneer, first crossed
the Alleghany Mountains and came into this beautiful
region. Seeing the tall forest trees and plentiful game,
he thought it would be a good place to live in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>After wandering about it for months, and escaping from
the hands of some Indians who had taken him captive,
Boone made up his mind to settle there. He therefore went
back to North Carolina for his wife and daughter, and,
with his brother and several other pioneers, returned to
Kentucky where he formed a settlement called Boones´bor-o
(1775). Like all pioneer villages, this was merely
a collection of a few log huts, surrounded by a tall
palisade to serve as a rampart against Indian attacks.</p>

<p>Boone's daughter and two younger girls, little suspecting
danger, once went out in a canoe to pick flowers along
the banks of a stream. Suddenly several Indians sprang
out of a thicket, seized them, and bore them off into the
woods. While the younger girls cried helplessly, Boone's
daughter, seeing it was of no use to struggle, quietly followed
her captor. But she took care to leave the print of
her shoe here and there where the soil was damp, to break
twigs of bushes, and to fasten shreds of her dress to the
briers along the way, so that her tracks could be followed.</p>

<p>As soon as the girls' capture was discovered, Boone and
six other men set out in pursuit. Thanks to the girl's
clever way of marking her passage, they soon came to
where the savages were camping in the woods. Creeping
up stealthily, the white men noiselessly got between the
children and the Indians, for they knew the latter would
kill and scalp their captives at the first alarm. The Indians,
suddenly finding themselves in danger, hastily fled,
leaving captives and weapons behind them.</p>

<p>In the third year of the Revolutionary War, some Indians,
hired by the British to make war along the frontier, came
to attack Boonesboro. But the place was so gallantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
defended by the settlers that they could not get in.
They vainly directed a steady fire against the palisades for
some time, and then withdrew to a short distance to rest.</p>

<p>The settlers, who had very little powder within the
palisade, were anxious to secure a keg full of powder that
was standing in a hut near by. Still, they knew that if a
man ventured out, the Indians would probably kill him,
and they did not feel that they could spare a single one.
A brave girl, Elizabeth Zane, therefore insisted upon
going, for she said they could easily get along without
her, although they needed
all the men.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/illus_p290.jpg" width="375" height="441" alt="zane" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Elizabeth Zane brings Powder.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At her request, the gate
was opened, and she sped
like an arrow to the house
where the powder
had been left.
The Indians, astonished
at the
sight of a woman
running out of
the fort, stood
perfectly still. In
a few seconds
they saw her rush
back, her apron
full of powder.
Now they understood
what it all
meant; but it was too late to stop the brave girl, who had
reached the fort in safety. The powder thus secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
saved the settlement; for the Indians, after losing many
men, gave up the siege and went home.</p>

<p>In 1778, while out hunting, Boone was captured by
Indians, who carried him off to Detroit. They were about
to kill him when an old squaw claimed him to take the
place of her son who had been slain. The Indians consented,
and Boone was adopted by the squaw, who pulled
out all his hair, except a scalp lock, which she dressed
with feathers in fine Indian style.</p>

<p>Boone now made believe to be quite satisfied to stay
with the Indians; so they took him out hunting every day,
giving him only a certain amount of powder and bullets.
Boone was such a good marksman that he soon found he
could kill his game with half a bullet and less powder. He
therefore secretly cut his bullets in two, and although he
brought back a bird, rabbit, or deer for every charge the
savages gave him, he really saved half his ammunition
without their suspecting it.</p>

<p>When he had thus collected enough powder and bullets,
Boone stole a piece of dried meat and some parched corn,
and went out hunting, as usual. But as soon as he got out
of sight he began running as hard as he could. As he ran
he hid his traces, so the Indians could not follow him.
Thus he darted along fallen trees, jumped from stone to
stone, ran up and down shallow streams, and once, at least,
grasped a trailing grapevine, and, swinging hard, landed
on his feet a long distance ahead.</p>

<p>The Indians, finding out his escape, soon started to
follow him; but while they were hunting around for his
broken tracks, he ran on, pausing to rest only when his
strength gave out. Boone thus reached the Ohio, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
he had the good luck to find a leaky canoe, in which he
paddled across the stream.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, he used one of the bullets he
had saved to kill a turkey, which he roasted over the first
fire he had dared to light since
his escape. Tramping thus all
the way from the Indian camp
to Boonesboro, Boone found
his home deserted. At first
he thought all his family
had been killed; but he
soon heard they had merely
gone back to their old home,
thinking he was dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus_p292.jpg" width="200" height="372" alt="grapevine" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Boone's Grapevine.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As he knew the Indians would
soon come to attack Boonesboro,
Boone collected about fifty-five
men, who helped him repair
the palisade. They were scarcely
through their work when more than
four hundred Indians appeared, led
by a French officer serving in the
British army. When they bade Boone
surrender, he answered: "We are determined
to defend our fort while a man of us lives."</p>

<p>Although the Indians tried to break into the fort, they
were driven back, and their bullets had no effect on the
heavy logs of the palisade. Next they made an attempt
to set fire to the fort, but the flames were quickly quenched;
and when they began to tunnel a way into the place, they
were forced to give it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Weary of vain attempts, the Indians finally withdrew;
and when they had gone, Boone and his companions picked
up a hundred and twenty-five pounds of bullets, which
had fallen harmlessly along the palisade. Later on, Boone
brought his family back to Kentucky; but the Indians
continued to make trouble during the next ten years.
Still, when those dark days were all over, so many settlers
came into Kentucky that Boone declared the place was
too crowded for him, and said he needed more elbow-room.</p>

<p>He therefore removed first to a place near the Great
Ka-na´wha, and then to Missouri, which at that time belonged
to Spain. Here he lived long enough to see many
settlers cross the Mississippi. He was again saying that
he felt crowded, and talking of moving still farther west,
when he died, at the age of eighty-five, still hale and hearty,
and a famous hunter and pioneer.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXVI. FAMOUS SEA FIGHTS.</h2>


<p>While American patriots were busy fighting the
British on land, others, equally brave, were fighting
them at sea. As soon as the war began, Congress gave
seamen letters of marque, which were permissions to attack
and seize any British vessel they met.</p>

<p>The bravest and best known of all the American seamen
of this time was John Paul Jones. Although born in Scotland,
he adopted this country for his own, and, when the
War of Independence began, offered his services to Congress.
He proved such an able seaman that in 1777 he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
was sent to France on an important errand. Although
the French did not give him a large ship, as he had hoped,
he boldly cruised around in a little American vessel called
the <i>Ranger</i>, on which he hoisted the first American flag
ever seen and saluted at sea.</p>

<p>Paul Jones sailed boldly along, capturing and sinking
English vessels, and even running into the port of White-ha´ven,
where he tried to burn all the shipping. Then, as
his boat was no longer good enough to continue fighting,
he went back to France, in quest of a long-promised new
ship. But after five months' weary delay, he was still
ashore and waiting.</p>

<p>One day he read in "Poor Richard's Almanac": "If you
would have your business done, go; if not, send." This
saying seemed so true that he immediately set out for Paris.
There he managed to talk to the French minister, who
again promised him a fine ship. But when the young seaman
saw this craft, five days later, he was sorely disappointed,
for it was both old and clumsy.</p>

<p>Still, any kind of a ship was better than no ship at all; so
Paul Jones named it <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> (bŏ-nŏm´ re-shar´),
a French translation of "Poor Richard." Then he set sail
in it, accompanied by a few smaller vessels, and coasted
along the North Sea. There Jones ran near the shore,
where his visits were so dreaded that, we are told, an old
Scotch minister at Kirk-cal´dy once prayed: "Now, dear
Lord, don't you think it a shame for you to send this vile
pirate to rob our folk of Kirkcaldy? You know that they
are poor enough already, and have nothing to spare."</p>

<p>Still, Paul Jones was not so vile a pirate as the old
minister supposed, for whenever he landed for provisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
he paid the poor people for the food and cattle he took.
We are also told that, his men having once robbed a castle
of its silver plate, Jones sent it all back, eight years later,
with a polite note.</p>

<p>But while Jones did not wish to harm the poor, he did
want to damage the British navy as much as he could. He
therefore cruised about until he met the <i>Se-rā´pis</i>, a British
man-of-war, off Flam´-bor-ough
Head(1779).
Here was waged one
of the fiercest naval
battles ever fought.
Although Jones's ship
was afire from the very
beginning, his guns all
disabled, the vessel
shot away between
decks and slowly sinking,
he boldly lashed
it fast to the <i>Serapis</i>.
While doing so he
heard one of his men
swear, and turning
to him, quietly said:
"Don't swear, sir; in
another moment we
may all be in eternity."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus_p295.jpg" width="200" height="328" alt="richard" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Bonhomme Richard and the Serapis.</p></div>
</div>

<p>By this time the
smoke was so thick that the British captain could not see
whether the American flag had been hauled down. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
therefore shouted: "Have you struck your colors?" But
Jones coolly answered: "I have not yet begun to fight."
Such was Jones's pluck that the British commander finally
yielded; but when he gave up his sword to Paul Jones, he
haughtily said: "It is with great reluctance that I surrender
my sword to a man who fights with a halter round
his neck."</p>

<p>Paul Jones gave him back the weapon, politely saying:
"Captain Pearson, you have fought like a hero, and I have
no doubt that your sovereign will reward you for it in
the most ample manner." These words came true, for
after Captain Pearson had been duly exchanged, George
III. called him to court and made him a knight.</p>

<p>As the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> was sinking, Jones transferred
his men and prisoners to the <i>Serapis</i>. Then he
sadly watched his own ship settle down and vanish beneath
the waves. The <i>Serapis</i> was next taken to France,
where it was discovered that Captain Landais (lah<span class="smcap">N</span>-dā´),
the French commander of one of the smaller vessels in
Jones's fleet, was insane. Paul Jones and his men had
known this for some time, because Landais had disobeyed
orders several times, and when the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>
was fighting against the <i>Serapis</i>, he had even used his
cannon against it instead of attacking the enemy.</p>

<p>The news of Paul Jones's victory caused great rejoicings
both in America and in France, and when the young captain
returned to the latter country, he was invited to court
with Franklin. King Louis XVI. heard Jones's account
of the fight, and told him that his enemy, Captain Pearson
had just been knighted, and had received a new ship.
Paul Jones then gayly answered: "Well, he deserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the honor, and if I meet him in his new ship I'll make a
lord of him."</p>

<p>This answer greatly amused the king; but at the same
time it showed that Paul Jones, hero as he was, had one
great fault&mdash;that of boasting. When he came back to
America, Congress honored him; but as the young sailor
did not think his services were well enough appreciated
in America, he left our country soon after the war was
ended, and went to serve Russia.</p>

<p>Paul Jones was not the only hero on the seas at this
time, for we are told the American privateers captured
five hundred British vessels in three years, secured much
booty, and did great harm to the shipping in several
English ports.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXVII. THE "SWAMP FOX."</h2>


<p>The British had failed not only in their first attempt,
against Boston, but also in their second,&mdash;to seize the
Hudson valley and thus separate the southern colonies
from New England. But as they were not yet ready to
give up the struggle, they decided to try a third plan.
That was to begin a new campaign in the far south, and
march up the Atlantic coast, leaving nothing but conquered
people behind them.</p>

<p>In 1778, therefore, they began their operations by
besieging and taking Savannah. Soon after, they became
masters of Au-gus´ta and of nearly all Georgia. These
successes delighted them, for, with one province won, they
fancied they would soon be masters of all the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Still, before they could do much more, the French fleet
under D'Estaing (des-ta<span class="smcap">N</span>´), and an American army under
Lincoln, came to recover Savannah. While the French
were bombarding that city from their ships, the Americans,
led by Pulaski, tried to storm it (1779).</p>

<p>But in spite of a most gallant charge, the patriots were
driven back with great loss. Among the dead was Sergeant
Jasper, still holding the flag given him at Fort
Moultrie, and Count
Pulaski, the generous
Pole who had joined
the army and served
under Washington in
the battle of the Brandywine.
Both of these
men were so brave that
their names will never
be forgotten, and in Savannah
fine monuments
have been erected
in their honor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus_p298.jpg" width="200" height="295" alt="pulaski" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Pulaski's Monument in Savannah.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first attempt to
take Savannah having
failed, the French admiral
refused to lend any
more aid to the Americans
in the South. So
Lincoln, after defending
Charleston alone for forty days, was forced to surrender.
The British, coming to the city, exacted such hard conditions
from him that they roused the indignation of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
true Americans. But when the British minister heard that
the city was taken, he proudly cried: "We look on America
as at our feet!"</p>

<p>The British now overran the state, behaving most cruelly
everywhere. An officer named Tarle´ton not only burned
houses, and beat women and children, but when some
Americans asked for quarter,&mdash;that is, vowed not to fight
any more if he would spare their lives,&mdash;he broke his
promise and had them all killed. Because he did not keep
his word, the expression "Tarleton's quarter" was used in
the South as a term for immediate death.</p>

<p>Although by Lincoln's surrender one American army
was lost, the patriots were not ready to give up yet, and
as soon as another force was raised, Gates was sent southward
to command it. He was so proud of his victory at
Saratoga that he started out full of confidence. When he
stopped, on his way, to visit Lee, the latter, hearing him
boast, quietly remarked: "Take care your northern laurels
do not turn to southern willows."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, Gates paid no heed to this
warning. Thinking he would soon force Cornwallis to
surrender, he was very imprudent, and when he met the
British at Cam´den, a few months later (1780), he suffered
a defeat instead of winning a victory. We are told
that when he saw the day was lost, Gates turned and fled,
never daring to stop until he had put about eighty miles
between himself and his foes. The German officer De
Kalb, who had so generously come to help the Americans,
fought in this battle with great courage, and died from
the eleven wounds he received there. He is buried at
Camden, where a monument marks his resting place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
This was the worst battle for the Americans during the
whole war, and it was speedily followed by the loss of
nearly all South Carolina. The only people who still had
courage to fight were a few patriots led by such heroes as
Mār´i-on, Sumter, and Pickens.</p>

<p>The first of these three men was so upright, brave, and
gentlemanly that he has often been compared to a brave
French knight, and is therefore known as the "Bay´ard of
the South." Marion and his men had retreats in the woods
and swamps, whence they made sudden raids upon the
British. It seems that the latter, wishing to exchange
prisoners, once sent an officer into one of these hiding
places under a flag of truce. As Marion did not wish the
British to learn the way to his retreat, this officer was
blindfolded and led a long distance. When his bandage
was removed, he was surprised to find himself, not in a
fort or house, as he had expected, but in a lonely spot
in the woods. Marion stepped forward, politely offered
him a seat on a log, and, when business was over,
cordially invited him to share his dinner.</p>

<p>The officer was just wondering where his dining room
could be, when one of the ragged soldiers appeared, carrying
a piece of bark on which smoked some sweet potatoes,
roasted in the camp fire. Marion helped his guest
to a potato on a chip, and began to eat one himself
with a relish. Of course the British officer immediately
followed his example; but he soon asked whether the
American officers often dined so simply. Marion, the
"Swamp Fox," answered, "Yes;" and then gayly added,
"but we are fortunate on this occasion, having company
to entertain, to have more than our usual allowance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p301.jpg" width="450" height="355" alt="dinner" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Marion's Dinner.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The officer, hearing this, suggested that the Americans
probably gave their soldiers big pay to make up for such
poor fare and uncomfortable quarters. But Marion truthfully
answered that he received no salary at all. The
astonished officer then asked why he served such a mean
country at all; and the brave young Southerner, looking
him full in the face, proudly remarked that a man was
always ready to do anything for the lady he loved, and
that the name of his sweetheart was Liberty.</p>

<p>The British officer could not but admire such a man and
such an answer. On returning to camp, we are told,
he left the service, saying he would have no share in depriving
such brave men as Marion of the rights due
them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>




<h2>LXXVIII. THE POOR SOLDIERS.</h2>


<p>In the meantime things were going very badly in the
North. The winter spent at Valley Forge had, indeed,
been hard to bear, but that which Washington spent at
Morristown was in some respects even worse. Congress,
in those days, had no power to tax the people to raise
money, the states were in many cases too poor to supply
much, and it was very difficult to borrow funds abroad,
because it was quite evident that if the Americans were
beaten their debts would never be paid.</p>

<p>Already in 1777 Congress began to issue paper money.
Of course it had no real value of its own, like gold or silver,
but was merely a promise that Congress would some day
give the bearer the amount it called for in real money.
As everybody knew that Congress did not have, and
therefore could not give, gold or silver in exchange for
these "continental bills," no one liked to take them in payment
for food or clothing.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the British printed ever so many
bills just like those issued by Congress, and paper money
soon became so nearly worthless as to give rise to the
expression still used, "Not worth a continental." By this
time there was two hundred millions' worth of this money
in circulation, and people gave one hundred and fifty
dollars in bills for a bushel of corn, and several thousand
for a suit of clothes, when they had no silver or gold.</p>

<p>Many times during the Revolutionary War the soldiers,
knowing their families were starving, clamored loudly for
their money. As it was not paid to them, some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
rebelled, and it took all their love for Washington&mdash;the
only person whom they really trusted&mdash;to hold the army
together. Still, these soldiers were faithful to their country;
for when British spies once came among them, offering
gold if they would only desert, they nobly gave these spies
up to their officers, saying that, while they wanted their
dues, they were not traitors.</p>

<p>The British not only tried to win over the men, but also
attempted to bribe American officers and statesmen. But
they failed in this, too; and when they approached Joseph
Reed, he proudly said: "I am not worth purchasing;
but such as I am, the King of Great Britain is not rich
enough to buy me."</p>

<p>Washington always supplied the needs of his men as far
as he could; but as he had been away from Mount Vernon
several years now, his fortune was much smaller than it had
been, and as time went on he had less and less ready
money. In despair at his men's sufferings, he wrote again
and again to Congress. Finally he warned Robert Morris,
who had charge of money matters, that it would be impossible
to keep the army together if food, money, and
clothing were not forthcoming right away.</p>

<p>This appeal proved successful. Morris not only gave all
the money he had, but, going from door to door, begged
from all his friends for the safety of the country. The
Philadelphians nobly answered his appeal, and on New
Year's Day Washington could gladden the soldiers' hearts
by giving them food and money. Shortly after, the Philadelphia
ladies, wishing to help also, sent him twenty-two
thousand shirts, which they had made for the almost naked
soldiers, who were glad to get into warm and whole garments.</p>

<h2>LXXIX. THE SPY.</h2>


<p>You may remember that Benedict Arnold marched
gallantly through the Maine woods to attack Quebec,
and was wounded there in the beginning of the
war. After his recovery he showed his courage in many
ways. For instance, he was once surrounded by Tories, who
killed his horse. While Arnold was trying to release his
foot from the stirrup, one of his foes rushed toward him,
crying, "Surrender!" "Not yet," answered Arnold,
and, drawing his pistol, he shot the Tory, jumped up, and
ran into the woods near by. There, finding another
horse, he quickly mounted, and came back to take part in
the fight once more.</p>

<p>You remember, too, how he won the victory of Stillwater,
with Morgan and Schuyler, while Gates was lingering
idly in his tent. On this occasion, however, Arnold
was again badly wounded. As he lay upon the ground,
helpless, one of the enemy, who had fought with great
valor and had fallen only a moment before him, slowly
raised himself, and, in spite of a bad wound, tried to get at
Arnold to kill him. Just then a friend of Arnold's came
up, and was about to slay the soldier, when Arnold stopped
him by crying: "For God's sake, don't hurt him; he is a
fine fellow!"</p>

<p>Although Arnold could thus show himself both brave
and forgiving, he had one great fault, his vanity. While
recovering from his wound, in Philadelphia, he got into
bad company, ran into debt, and behaved in such a way
that Congress bade Washington reprove him publicly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
his conduct. Washington did so as gently as he could,
and some time later, when Arnold asked him for the command
at West Point, he gladly granted this request; for
he knew that Arnold was brave, and thought he had
been treated rather unfairly. But no sooner had Arnold
secured this important place than, forgetting his duty to
his country and his honor as a man, he determined to
avenge his wrongs by giving up the fort to the British
(1780). He therefore began a secret correspondence with
General Clinton, and finally arranged to meet a British
officer, so as to settle the particulars of the affair with
him.</p>

<p>True to the appointment, Major John André came up
the Hudson in an English vessel, the <i>Vulture</i>. Landing at
night, he met Arnold as agreed; but their talk lasted until
morning, and the ship, being then discovered by the
Americans, was fired upon. It therefore dropped down
the river. Seeing that he could not join it without running
too great a risk of discovery, André now got a pass
from Arnold. He then crossed the Hudson, and set out
for New York on horseback, reaching Tăr´ry-town in
safety, although travelers were then often stopped by
parties of "Skinners" or "Cowboys," as marauding British
and American troops were generally called. André was
just beginning to think that all danger of capture was over,
when three men suddenly sprang out of the bushes, seized
his horse, and forced him to dismount.</p>

<p>Although André offered his horse, his watch, and a
large sum of money to these three men if they would only
let him go, they held him fast and began searching him.
At first they found nothing suspicious; but in his boots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
they finally discovered plans of the fort at West Point,
and other important papers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p306.jpg" width="450" height="445" alt="captors" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">André and his Captors.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sure that they held a spy, Paulding, Williams, and Van
Wart now sent word to Arnold to look out, for they had
caught a spy, and then
they took André to White
Plains. Arnold was at
breakfast when the notice
of André's capture reached him. Rising from the table, he
hurriedly explained matters to his fainting wife, kissed his
child good-by, and, mounting his horse, galloped wildly off
to the river. There he found his boat, as usual, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
rowed off to the <i>Vulture</i>. The British, who had watched
his approach, received him in grim silence; for while they
would have been glad to take advantage of his baseness,
they all despised him as a traitor.</p>

<p>Washington, then on his way to West Point, received
the news of André's arrest too late to seize Arnold,
although he tried very hard to do so. Still, he did not
forget that Arnold's wife was innocent. Pitying her
evident suffering, he soon sent her word that her husband
had escaped, and said that she would be allowed to join
him in New York.</p>

<p>The news of Arnold's treachery, which wrung tears from
Washington, and made him exclaim, "Whom can we trust
now?" filled the whole country with dismay. People
were horror-struck; but while all hated Arnold, many
were almost as excited over the capture and probable
fate of André. An artist, writer, and soldier, this young
man had many admirers; but as he had played the part of
a spy, and had been captured in disguise within the American
lines, most people thought he deserved to be hanged.</p>

<p>Still, it was felt that Arnold, the traitor, was the one
who merited that death most, so when the British protested
that André should not be hanged, the Americans
offered to exchange him for Arnold, thinking that if they
could only make an example of the real culprit it would
prevent similar cases in the future.</p>

<p>But, much as the British despised Arnold, they could
not, of course, give him up. André's trial, therefore, went
on, and the jury condemned him to death as a spy. Instead
of treating him as the British had treated Hale, however,
the Americans allowed him to write to his friends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
prepare for death. When he was ready, André paid
the penalty of his wrongdoing by being hanged. Still,
people have always felt sorry for him, and the British,
who would have gained greatly by his spying, declared
that he had fallen a martyr. They therefore gave him a
place in Westminster Abbey, where many of their greatest
men are buried. Besides, two monuments have been
erected for him in our country, at Tarrytown and Tap´pan,
thus marking the places where he was captured and
hanged.</p>

<p>But, although André was hanged, his sufferings were
slight and merciful compared with those of Arnold. This
was just; for, while the former had tried to serve his country,
the latter had betrayed his trust, and it was natural
that his conscience should trouble him night and day.
Although the British, as they had promised, gave him a
large sum of money and a place in their army, none of
their officers ever treated him as a friend.</p>

<p>We are told that Washington, still anxious to secure
and punish Arnold for the country's sake, made a plan
to seize him shortly after his escape. An officer named
Campe deserted the American army, by Washington's
orders, and&mdash;narrowly escaping recapture by his comrades,
who were not in the secret&mdash;swam out to a British
vessel anchored in New York Bay. The enemy, having
breathlessly watched his escape from his pursuers, welcomed
him warmly, and, without asking any questions, allowed
him to enlist in Arnold's new regiment.</p>

<p>Campe intended, with the help of two other patriots,
to seize and gag Arnold when he was walking alone in his
garden, as he did every night. Thence they meant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
convey him to a boat, row him secretly across the river,
and hand him over to one of Washington's most devoted
officers, Henry Lee, who was called "Light-Horse Harry,"
to distinguish him from the Lee who disgraced himself at
Monmouth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on the very night when Campe's plan
was to have been carried out, Arnold took his regiment
on board a vessel in the bay, and sailed south to fight for
the British in Virginia. There poor Campe had to wait
for months before he got a chance to desert Arnold and
rejoin his countrymen. Until then all his fellow-soldiers
had believed him a real deserter; but after welcoming him
cordially, Washington and Lee publicly told the others
how nobly Campe had tried to serve his country, and
how nearly he had secured the traitor.</p>

<p>While fighting in the South, we are told, Arnold
once asked one of his prisoners, "What do you suppose
my fate would be if my misguided countrymen were to
take me prisoner?" The man, who was a good American,
promptly answered: "They would cut off the leg
that was wounded at Quebec and Saratoga, and bury it
with the honors of war; but the rest of you they would
hang on a gibbet."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXX. A TRAITOR'S DEATH.</h2>


<p>Before continuing the story of the Revolutionary
War, it is well to finish this painful story of a traitor.
After fighting against his country in Virginia, and burning
many houses and villages there, Arnold was sent into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Connecticut, where he set fire to New London, watching
the flames from the church tower. But soon after this
Arnold went to London, where he spent most of the rest
of his life, with few friends.</p>

<p>We are told that no one respected him there, and once,
when he went into Parliament to hear the speeches, a member
pointed right at him, saying: "Mr. Speaker, I will
not speak while that man is in the house." Another time
Arnold was introduced to a British officer who had fought
against him at Saratoga. But, while this man had then
admired him for his courage, and would have been proud
to know him, he now refused to shake hands with him,
curtly saying that he could not endure traitors.</p>

<p>A gentleman who did not know Arnold's story once
asked him for letters of introduction to his friends, saying
he was about to sail for America. But the traitor sadly
answered: "I was born in America; I lived there to the
prime of my life; but, alas! I can call no man in America
my friend." In fact, even his children were so ashamed
of what he had done that two of his sons changed their
name as soon as they grew up.</p>

<p>After living thus twenty years, bereft of his own as
well as public respect, Arnold on his deathbed begged
for the epaulets and sword-knot which Washington had
once given him, and cried: "Let me die in my old American
uniform, in which I fought my battles. God forgive
me for ever having put on any other!"</p>

<p>Arnold was buried in England. While his victories are
honored in America, his treachery has made his name so
disliked that it is always coupled with the words "the
traitor." The battles of Saratoga, where he, Schuyler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and Morgan really won the victories attributed to Gates,
are kept in mind by history and by the beautiful monument
at Saratoga. There you can see four niches. Three
are occupied by statues of Gates, Schuyler, and Morgan;
but the fourth&mdash;which was to contain a statue of Arnold&mdash;must
always remain empty!</p>

<p>The sadness which filled all patriot hearts in the country
at the news of Arnold's treason was, however, soon
made more bearable by the welcome tidings of a victory
in the South&mdash;the battle of Kings Mountain (1780).</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p311.jpg" width="450" height="314" alt="kings" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Battle of Kings Mountain.</p></div>
</div>

<p>More than a thousand of the British troops took up their
position on the top of this mountain, and their leader then
cried: "Well, boys, here is a place from which all the rebels
outside of hell cannot drive us!" Still, a smaller number of
patriots climbed up by three different paths, and, hiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
behind rocks and trees, killed many of the British, and
took the rest prisoners.</p>

<p>General Greene, taking command of the American
forces in the South after Gates's defeat at Camden, found
himself at the head of a ragged and almost famished army.
But stout hearts beat beneath tattered garments, and the
forces under Morgan soon after won a great victory at
Cowpens (1781).</p>

<p>The cruel Tarleton was in command on this occasion,
and during the battle he was wounded by Colonel William
Washington, a distant relative of the general in chief. In
speaking of the battle afterwards, Tarleton scornfully remarked
to an American lady that Colonel Washington
was so ignorant a man that he could not even write his
own name. As people who could not write in those days
were in the habit of making a rough mark instead of signing
their names, the lady archly said, pointing to his
wound: "Ah, colonel, you bear evidence that he can at
least make his mark!" When Tarleton later added that
he wondered what Colonel Washington looked like, the
same lady slyly said: "Had you only looked behind you
at Cowpens, you might have had that pleasure."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXXI. TWO UNSELFISH WOMEN.</h2>


<p>When the battle of Cowpens was over, and the few
remnants of Tarleton's force had fled to join Cornwallis,
the latter marched forward, hoping to catch up
with Morgan's army and crush it with his superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
force before it could join Greene's forces. Both armies
were therefore anxious to reach the ford over the Ca-taw´ba
first, and tramped ahead as fast as possible, stopping to
rest only when the men were completely exhausted. But,
in spite of the great odds against him, Morgan finally managed
to give Cornwallis the slip, and, crossing at the ford,
was soon joined by Greene. The two generals continued
the retreat, cleverly tempting Cornwallis to follow, until
finally the whole American army was safe beyond the Dan
River in Virginia.</p>

<p>We are told that it was during this race for the Dan that
Greene once stopped at the house of a patriot Southern
lady, Mrs. Steele. She quickly supplied him with warm
garments and food, and hearing him say he could not pay
her because he was penniless, she brought him all her savings,
which she forced him to accept and use for the sake
of his country.</p>

<p>It seems also that in the course of this campaign the
Americans laid siege to a house which served as a fort
for British soldiers. Although Light-Horse Harry Lee
was very anxious to secure these men, he soon found that
he could not drive them out of the house. He therefore
asked Mrs. Motte, owner of the place, whether she would
allow him to set fire to it, to force the British out.</p>

<p>She not only consented to this,&mdash;although the house
was all she had,&mdash;but brought Lee an Indian bow and
arrows, so that he could shoot bits of flaming wood upon
the shingled roof. The house was thus soon in flames,
and the British, seeing they would be roasted alive if they
staid in it, and shot if they tried to escape, promptly surrendered.
Then the fire was put out, and as it had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
yet gained much headway, Mrs. Motte did not, after all,
lose the house which she had been willing to sacrifice for
the sake of her country.</p>

<p>As was the case all through the Southern campaign,
the British were very cruel; still, a few patriots managed
to escape from their clutches. For example, one of
Tarleton's men once ordered a prisoner to give him the
silver buckles he wore. The man proudly bade the Englishman
take them if he wanted them. Knowing that he
would be slain if he did not escape, the American killed
the man kneeling before him, and, jumping on a riderless
horse, dashed away. Before any of the four hundred men
around there thought of pursuing him, he was out of reach.</p>

<p>As soon as his men had rested a little from their fatigues,
Greene again led them against the British, whom he met
at Guil´ford Courthouse in North Carolina. Here, although
the Americans behaved with great valor, the British won
the victory. But it was at the cost of so many lives that
when Fox, a British statesman, heard of it, he sadly exclaimed:
"Another such victory would ruin us!"</p>

<p>The site of the old Revolutionary battlefield at Guilford
Courthouse is now a beautiful park. Here are many interesting
statues, and in the museum, among other curiosities,
you can see British and American flags peacefully
crossed, showing that after the war was over the two
parties generously forgot the past and were ready to meet
as friends.</p>

<p>After the battle of Guilford Courthouse, Cornwallis retreated
to the coast, and Greene turned his attention to
the British forces farther south, with which he fought the
battles of Hobkirk Hill and Eu´taw Springs. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
latter engagement, Marion, surrounded by the foe, encouraged
his brave men by saying: "Hold up your
heads, boys! Three fires, three cheers, and a charge,
and you are free!" During the same engagement one of
Lee's men found himself alone and without arms in the
midst of the enemy. With great presence of mind, he
seized an officer, wrenched his sword out of his hand, and,
using him as a shield, fought his way back to his friends.</p>

<p>Though Greene was often defeated and never won a
great victory, the British loudly complained that he never
knew when he was beaten. But while Greene modestly
described his own doings as, "We fight, get beat, rise and
fight again," he and his two thousand men were little by
little driving the British out of South Carolina. Indeed, by
their brave efforts the Americans finally recovered both
South Carolina and Georgia, with the exception of the
cities of Charleston and Savannah.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXXII. THE SURRENDER OF CORNWALLIS.</h2>


<p>Retreating from the Carolinas, Cornwallis marched
into Virginia to take the place of Arnold, whom
the British had been watching closely, lest he should
betray them, too. Clinton now bade Cornwallis keep
near the coast, so that he could embark quickly and
come to the rescue of New York, in case Washington
should suddenly attack it.</p>

<p>The fact was, though, that Washington had no intention
of doing anything of the sort. On the contrary, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
laid his plans to catch Cornwallis in Virginia, where he
had sent Lafayette some time before. As he did not wish
Clinton to suspect this plan, Washington wrote letters
saying he meant to take New York, and cleverly contrived
that they should accidentally fall into British hands.
After reading them, Clinton felt so sure he knew all about
the American plans that he did not stir.</p>

<p>There was no telegraph in those days, and it was a great
surprise to Cornwallis when the French fleet, under De
Grasse (grahss) suddenly appeared in Chesapeake Bay.
Thus, even before Clinton suspected the Americans' intentions,
Cornwallis was hemmed in at Yorktown between
Lafayette's troops and De Grasse's fleet, and Washington
was rapidly marching southward to help them.</p>

<p>Hoping to check Washington's advance, or even force
him to come back, Clinton now sent Arnold into Connecticut,
where, as we have seen, he burned New London.
This base deed so angered a lady whose guest he had once
been, that she tried to shoot him, we are told, and would
have done so, had not her gun missed fire.</p>

<p>Arnold, and the British officers with him, proved very
cruel all through this campaign; and when one of them
seized Fort Griswold, near New London, he haughtily
demanded, "Who commands here?" "I did," courteously
answered the American officer, coming forward to
surrender his sword, "but you do now." The British
officer took the weapon, ran it through its owner, and
coolly bade his men kill all the garrison in the same way.</p>

<p>Although the news of pillage, burning, and murder was
carried to Washington as quickly as possible, he did not&mdash;as
Clinton perhaps expected&mdash;turn around to defend Connecticut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
but kept steadily on. As he marched by,
all good Americans wildly cheered him, crying: "Long
live Washington! He is going to catch Cornwallis in his
mouse trap!" Indeed, such was the faith people had in
him that an old patriot, coming into the room where he
was dining, raised his arms to heaven and solemnly cried,
like Simeon in the Bible: "Lord, now lettest thou thy
servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation."</p>

<p>On his way to Yorktown, Washington paid a flying visit
to his home at Mount Vernon, which he had not seen since
he left it to attend the Continental Congress six years
before. There he learned that it would have been burned
to the ground, had not his steward bribed some British
soldiers to let it stand. When Washington heard this, he
gravely said that he would rather lose all he had, than
save it by making friends with his country's foes.</p>

<p>Reaching Yorktown,&mdash;where Cornwallis had once boasted
that he would soon capture "that boy," as he scornfully
termed Lafayette,&mdash;Washington found all his orders so
well carried out that the bombarding of the city could
begin without further delay. The French fleet and
American army worked together to such good purpose
that before long it became plain that Cornwallis would
have to yield. During this siege a gentleman carefully
pointed out his own house, advising Washington to batter
it down first with his cannon; for he thought that Cornwallis
must have selected it for his headquarters, because
it was the best in town.</p>

<p>Washington, who was never wounded in any battle,
stood on a height directing the movements of his troops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
He was in such an exposed place that some of his aids,
hoping to make him change his position, ventured to
remark that they were in great danger. "If you think
so," answered Washington, quietly, "you are at liberty to
step back." But as he did not move, the others bravely
stood their ground.</p>

<p>A moment later a ball struck a cannon only a few feet
off, and General Knox impulsively cried, "My dear general,
we can't spare you yet!" and tried to drag him away.
But Washington carelessly remarked, "It's a spent ball,"
and stood there like a rock until he saw the redoubt taken.
Then he joyfully exclaimed: "The work is done, and well
done!"</p>

<p>Washington was right; the work was done, and the
patriots' troubles nearly over. Cornwallis, finding himself
unable to escape or receive help, was forced to surrender
on the 19th of October, 1781. But his pride was so
hurt at having to give up his sword, that he pretended
illness, and sent one of his officers to carry it to Washington.
The latter, remembering how the British had tried
to shame General Lincoln at the surrender of Charleston,
therefore bade the British officer deliver it to Lincoln.</p>

<p>The next day, when the British troops marched out of
Yorktown between the French and American armies,
their bands dolefully played: "The World Turned Upside
Down." Washington, ever considerate of people's feelings,
had given strict orders that his soldiers should not
jeer at the enemy, or make any unkind remarks. This
order was obeyed, but Lafayette, seeing that the British&mdash;who
had made such unmerciful fun of him&mdash;did not
even look up, suddenly bade his band strike up "Yankee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Doodle." At this hated sound the British all started, and
Lafayette had the boyish satisfaction of knowing that
they had seen him heading part of the forces which had
conquered them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXXIII. THE BRITISH FLAG HAULED
DOWN.</h2>


<p>The news of the surrender of Cornwallis filled all
American hearts with joy; for our people knew, as
well as the British, that the war was now ended. The
tidings reached Philadelphia at night, while the watchman,
making his rounds as usual, was passing up and down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
streets. To the customary announcement of the time,
and the cry, "All's well," he therefore added, "and Cornwallis
is taken!"</p>

<p>The joy of this event proved fatal to the old doorkeeper
of Congress, while on all sides bells were rung and
loud cheers were heard. On the next day the members
of Congress marched in a body to church, to return thanks
for the "victory of a great and good man in a great and
good cause." But when the news reached England it
caused great dismay. We are told that Lord North fell
back as if struck by a cannon ball, and gasped: "O God,
it is all over!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus_p320.jpg" width="450" height="360" alt="newburgh" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Washington's Headquarters at Newburgh.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Although the War of Independence was really over, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
several Americans went to Europe to settle the terms of
peace, British troops staid in America some time longer, and
kept possession of Savannah and Charleston about a year.
Washington, therefore, did not dare dismiss his army. To
keep better guard over the British at New York, he collected
all his forces at Newburgh. But although there was no more
fighting, Washington's presence was more sorely needed
than ever, for the men, having received only a small part
of their long-promised pay, and unable to go home and work
for their destitute families, were restless and discontented.
In fact, even the officers thought Congress managed things
badly, and wished to make Washington king.</p>

<p>Had Washington thought of himself more than of others,
or been unduly ambitious, he could now have gone, at the
head of the army, to overthrow Congress and take the
power into his own hands, like Cæsar and Napoleon. But
Washington was a real patriot, and had no thought beyond
the good of his country. He therefore sent for his
officers, and made them a little speech.</p>

<p>In reading a letter from a congressman, promising that
they should receive their dues, he had to take out his
glasses, and as he put them on he quietly begged them
to excuse him, saying: "My eyes have grown dim in the
service of my country, but I have never doubted her
justice." In his address he urged them not to tarnish the
glory of their past services by rash conduct, and explained
that Congress would soon settle their just demands. Such
was the reliance placed upon his mere word, and the good
influence he had over every man in his army, that all now
consented to wait patiently until their services could receive
their reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>While Washington was thus keeping the soldiers in
order, Franklin was in Europe, treating for peace. In
1782 George III. formally announced that he would
recognize the independence of the United States, and
closed his speech by saying he hoped that the same "religion,
language, interests, and affections might prove a bond
of permanent union between the two countries."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">RESULTS OF THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE<br />

BOUNDARY DEFINED BY TREATY 1783</p></div>
</div>

<p>The treaty, however, was signed in Paris, on the 3d
of September, 1783. On this occasion Franklin donned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the suit of Manchester velvet clothes which he had worn ten
years before, when insulted in Parliament, and which he
had vowed never to use again until his country was free.
By this treaty the seacoast from Maine to Georgia was
given up to the United States, together with all the land
between the Great Lakes and Florida, westward as far
as the Mississippi. At the same time, the British gave
Florida back to Spain.</p>

<p>The news of this treaty was followed by the departure
of the British soldiers from New York. They sailed
away, leaving their flag still floating from the top of the
liberty pole. Here some soldiers had nailed it fast, carefully
greasing the pole so that the Americans should not
haul down their colors until they were at least out of sight.</p>

<p>But a clever New York boy, seeing that it was useless
to try to climb the greased pole in the usual way, ran
into a neighboring store, and soon came back with a pocket
full of nails, some cleats, and a hammer. Nailing a cleat a
short distance up, he stood upon it to nail another still
higher, and, climbing thus from point to point, reached
the top of the pole, tore off the British flag, and replaced
it by the American colors, amid the cheers of the assembled
people!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXXIV. WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL.</h2>


<p>Washington had already disbanded his army in
Newburgh, when, on the eighth anniversary of the
battle of Lexington, the war was formally declared to be
over. Now, the British having gone, it remained only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
bid farewell to his officers. On this occasion he said:
"With a heart full of love and gratitude I now take leave
of you. I most devoutly wish that your latter days may
be as prosperous as your former have been glorious and
honorable. I cannot come to each of you to take my
leave, but I shall be obliged to you if each of you will
come and take me by the hand."</p>

<p>General Knox was the first to advance, and Washington
drew him toward him and kissed him. He also embraced
all the rest&mdash;in dead silence, for all hearts were too full for
speech. The officers then followed him to the boat and
silently watched him out of sight. From New York,
where this parting took place, Washington went direct to
Annapolis, where, on the 23d of December, 1783, he
received the formal message: "The United States, in
Congress assembled, is prepared to receive the communications
of the commander in chief." Washington then
appeared before that body to lay down the heavy charge
which he had borne so bravely for nearly eight years. He
again refused to accept any reward for his services but
handed over the exact account of his expenses, proving
that he had spent more than sixty-three thousand dollars
of his own money for the good of his country.</p>

<p>Then he went back to his farm at Mount Vernon, to
take up again his usual work. He had been longing to do
this for some time, for farming was his chief pleasure.
Knowing this, his officers formed a society of which they
made him head. They called themselves the Cincin-na´ti,
in honor of a Roman patriot, Cincinnatus, who
left his plow to save his country from danger, but hurried
back to it as soon as the war was over.</p>

<p>Instead of other pay, many of these officers and of the
continental soldiers now received grants of land in what
was then called the Northwest Territory. There they
soon settled, working hard, and serving their country just
as nobly by being good farmers, good citizens, good husbands,
and good fathers as they had done by being good
soldiers in the Revolutionary War. Before long, towns
sprang up in the wilderness, and one of them was named
Cincinnati, in honor of the society of which Washington
was the first president.</p>

<p>But there were others besides the soldiers who were
anxious to get back to their families. Foremost among
these was the worthy Franklin, who had spent nearly nine
years in France, looking after the interests of his country.
He had seen the Peace of Paris signed; and when he
reached Philadelphia, just sixty-two years after his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
visit, he was welcomed with loud cheers and great rejoicings.
He deserved all the cheering and honors he received,
for he had been second only to Washington in the
services he had rendered his beloved country.</p>

<p>As it was now decided beyond doubt that the former
colonies were to be free states, independent of Great
Britain, the Story of the Thirteen Colonies is ended.
There is still to be told the Story of the Great Republic
which was formed from these colonies, and which has
grown to be one of the foremost nations in the world.</p>
